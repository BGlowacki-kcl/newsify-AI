Three classic cars owned by Jamie Oliver are set to be offered to the highest bidder next month as the TV chef clears some space in his extended automotive collection.

The motors are a mix of the seventies Essex-boy favourite Ford Capri, a rare 1955 Fiat pick-up truck and a sixties VW Beetle with a bespoke matching trailer.

The auction house taking all three motors to the block said the cars to 'embody something of Jamie's 'cheeky chappie' persona and thus add to their collectability'.

Here's how much they could make when the hammer drops.

Pukka car collection: Jamie Oliver is set to offer three classic motors from his private garage to the highest bidder at an auction within weeks. Here's what makes each special - and how much they could sell for

The three cars from Jamie Oliver's eclectic collection will auctioned off by Classic Car Auctions on Saturday 28 September at Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire.

Arguably the pick of the bunch is the Naked Chef's 1970 Ford Capri 3000GT Mk1.

This is one of the most collectable examples of the first-generation Ford coupe, with Oliver's finished in Ermine White with a Black Vinyl interior.

Arguably the pick of the bunch is the Naked Chef's 1970 Ford Capri 3000GT Mk1, which has just 52,467 miles on the clock

This Capri has had just two owners from new. Jamie took possession in June 2014

During Jamie Oliver's ownership, the car was restored in line with its original specification at a cost of around £20,000

Described by Jamie as his 'go-to car', the Capri is well known and has made several appearances on the TV programme Jamie and Jimmy's Friday Night Feast

This is one of the most collectable examples of the first-generation Ford Capri, with Oliver's finished in Ermine White with a Black Vinyl interior

It is fitted with the well-proven, 3.0-litre Essex V6 engine producing 130bhp and offering 8.5 seconds to 60mph and 121 mph - impressive stats for a car that came off the assembly line some 54 years ago.

This is a two-owner car from new, with Jamie taking possession in June 2014.

During his ownership, the car was restored in line with its original specification at a cost of around £20,000.

Described by Jamie as his 'go-to car', the Capri is well known and has made several appearances on the TV programme Jamie and Jimmy's Friday Night Feast.

Within the history file are some old MOTs, an original V5 showing the first keeper and various details of the car on some social media platforms.

With only 52,467 miles on the clock, it's relatively low mileage for a motor of this era.

'We believe that there are only 31 of these 3000GTs currently on the road and consequently they're very collectable,' Simon Langsdale, car specialist at CCA said.

'This is the perfect opportunity to get behind the wheel of one with the added bonus of celebrity provenance.'

As such, the auction house estimates it could sell for a figure between £22,000 and £26,000 next month.

Also on offer is the TV personality's 1955 Fiat 1100/103 Series truck with just 26,677 miles on the clock

Offered on a 'No Reserve' basis, the pick-up should appeal as a 'classic commercial' vehicle that's adaptable for use by retro-inspired small businesses

This charismatic little pick-up was imported in 1973 and has had just three UK-keepers becoming the property of Jamie Oliver in 2012

The registration number - 677 YUM - is fitting given the existing owner...

CCA says the Fiat is original and 'unrestored'. Oliver has used it predominantly around the estate with occasional runs to the pub

Also on offer is the TV personality's fifties Fiat 1100/103 Series truck with just 42,932km on the clock from new - that's 26,677 miles to you and I.

Introduced in 1953, the cheeky-looking Fiat was available as a three-box saloon, coupé, estate, pick-up and a flat-bed 'Industriale'.

This charismatic little pick-up was imported in 1973 and has had just three UK-keepers becoming the property of Jamie Oliver in 2012.

'The registration number, 677 YUM is its original and seems rather appropriate considering its current owner,' Langsdale says.

'It's unrestored and appears essentially original, used predominantly around the estate with occasional runs to the pub, it has been maintained over the years.'

It is supplied with a small history file containing some old MOTs and a few invoices for works undertaken.

Offered on a 'No Reserve' basis, the pick-up should appeal on three levels: its celebrity provenance; as a 'classic commercial' vehicle that's adaptable for use by retro-inspired small businesses; and as a rare, but useful vehicle in its own right.

The final motor from the Oliver estate is a 1967 Karmann-built Type 1 VW Beetle Convertible, finished in Lotus White - though is actually cream

Again, it's relatively low mileage, with the odometer showing a mere 68,561km (42,602 miles)

As a smart example of the sought-after Karmann convertibles, this drop-top Beetle is appealing in its own right, but the addition of the ice cream trailer makes this unique package rather special

The car was imported into the UK in May 2013 and has had three keepers during that time, the current being Jamie

The bespoke matching trailer has been created using the back half of a very similar vehicle. It has been modified to incorporate an ice-cream fridge and condenser to be used at events

The final motor from the Oliver estate is a 1967 1500cc Karmann-built Type 1 VW Beetle Convertible, finished in Lotus White - though is actually cream.

The bespoke trailer is in fact the back half of a very similar vehicle modified to take an ice-cream fridge and condenser and designed to offer a platform for dispensing ice cream at events, private parties etc. offering a potential business opportunity for any interested buyer.

The car was imported into the UK in May 2013 and has had three keepers during that time, the current being Jamie.

It comes to sale with a good history file with details of work and ongoing maintenance.

As a smart example of the sought-after Karmann convertibles, this drop-top Beetle is appealing in its own right, but the addition of the ice cream trailer makes this unique package rather special.

Again, it's relatively low mileage, with the odometer showing a mere 68,561km (42,602 miles).

Similar to the Capri, it should make between £22,000 to £26,000.

CCA expects the three cars to generate plenty of attention and bids, given their background and celebrity ownership.

'The images of Jamie and his dog with the Collection speak of a passion for cars and a real fondness for these three charming vehicles, they seem to embody something of Jamie's 'cheeky chappie' persona and thus add to their collectability,' the auction house said.

            Title: I thought I had heat stroke but it was a deadly tropical virus; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/health/thought-heat-stroke-deadly-tropical-9519856; type: news; Description: A British tourist who thought she had heat stroke was diagnosed with a deadly tropical virus which causes flu-like symptoms. Serenity Tanner, 20, spent 12 days in hospital after being struck down with Dengue fever, which is passed to humans from mosquitos

Originally, Serenity put her symptoms down to heat stroke but after a few hours sleep she woke up and started vomiting. She was taken to a local medical centre by a neighbour and she was diagnosed with dengue fever.

Serenity was told that she would need to be flown by plane to the mainland for treatment and was taken to Makati Medical Centre, Manila, Philippines. After being discharged, Serenity flew back to the UK on August 19, 2024, and said she is still suffering from fatigue and brain fog.

Serenity, a student, from Warminster, Wiltshire, said: "I put it down to heat stroke - I thought I had been in the sun for too long. "Even now it has been weeks and I still feel the effects of the virus.

"I still have brain fog and feel tired all the time. I feel so weak, it was like I had been hit by a truck. I have had sepsis before and this was worse than that - it was horrendous. Physically I felt so weak - I was barely able to stand up."

On Friday 19, 2024, Serenity spent the day surfing with her boyfriend, Melvin Malinao, 27, when she started to feel unwell. Serenity put her symptoms down to heat stroke but after a few hours sleep she woke up and started vomiting.

She said: "I was spending time surfing and enjoying myself before I start university in September. After spending the day at a town on the other side of the island I started to feel really really unwell.

"I tried to have a few hours of sleep but I woke up vomiting and my fever got worse. The area we were staying in didn't have a hospital so my boyfriend and I were stuck wondering what we were going to do"

After a rough night, Serenity called an ambulance but there weren't any available. Luckily, their neighbour was able to drive them to the Dapa Rural Health Clinic - which was an hour and a half away from where they were staying.

Serenity said: "By the time we got there I was getting delusions, I felt that I had rope wrapped around me. "When I got out of the car I started to bleed out of my gums and I had a fever of 41 degrees. The nurses gave me some IV fluid and I was waiting at least four hours to see a doctor."

Serenity called her insurance and told them about her symptoms and they told her she needed to see a doctor immediately. She took the decision to discharge herself and go to a private health clinic 45 minutes away.

Serenity said: "We got in a tuk-tuk to this private clinic and when I got there I explained my symptoms. Straight away he said it was dengue fever - they told me I needed to go to a mainland hospital. I was at risk of internal bleeding and they didn't have the facilities for me.

"At this point, it was 6pm, I contacted my insurance but they couldn't do an air ambulance at night. The clinic couldn't admit me as they weren't open to admissions at night. "I made the decision to go home and wait for the morning to go to the mainland."

The next day, on July 21, 2024, Serenity was picked up by an ambulance and taken to Siargao Airport where a plane flew her to Makati Medical Centre, Manila. Once she arrived, she was taken to a ward and given an x-ray, had a blood test and put on an IV.

Serenity said: "Because it is a virus there is not much they can do to tackle it but they can try to manage the symptoms. I had a really high fever for nine days and I couldn't eat for 10 days. Three days before I was discharged I started to have acute liver failure and they gave me IV medication to improve my liver function."

After 12 days in hospital, Serenity was discharged on August 1, 2024, but said she was still "very weak". She said: "I still felt so weak, it was like I had been hit by a truck. I couldn't even stand up in the shower until the day I was discharged. I surfed a lot on the island and I tried to surf after I was discharged and I couldn't - I thought I was going to faint."

Serenity flew back to the UK on August 19, 2024, and said she is still feeling the effects of dengue fever a month after her diagnosis. She said: "It has been weeks and I still feel rough. I have brain fog and I feel tired all the time, I never realised how awful dengue is. It has been a month since I was diagnosed and I am still feeling the effects.";
        
            Title: Number of prisoners in England and Wales hits record high; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.impartialreporter.com/news/national/24551941.number-prisoners-england-wales-hits-record-high/; type: news; Description: The prison population of England and Wales has hit a record high, with the number jumping by nearly a thousand in the past four weeks.

Some 88,350 people were in prison as of August 30, Ministry of Justice figures show.

This is up 116 from 88,234 a week ago and an increase of 988 from 87,362 four weeks ago on August 2.

It is the highest end-of-week figure since weekly population data was first published in 2011, according to analysis by the PA news agency.

It also surpasses the highest total ever recorded, which was 88,336 at end the February 2024, based on separate figures for the end-of-month population size.

The sharp rise in recent weeks is likely to have been driven by the number of jail sentences handed to people found guilty of taking part in the recent disorder across parts of the country.

The prison population in England and Wales has been rising for much of the past three years, having dropped as low as 77,727 in April 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Before the pandemic, the figure had been above 80,000 since December 2006.

In the aftermath of the summer 2011 riots, the number climbed as high as 88,179 on December 2 2011, before falling back in subsequent months.;
        
            Title: Police probe into 'false statement under oath' in Alex Salmond inquiry; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/24552019.police-investigating-alleged-false-statement-salmond-probe/; type: news; Description: Lawyer Gordon Dangerfield told a Court of Session hearing on Friday that detectives are probing the alleged conduct of James Hynd.

Mr Dangerfield is representing the former First Minister in an action which he has brought against the Scottish Government.

Mr Salmond is seeking "significant damages" and compensation for loss of earnings that could total millions of pounds from Ministers.

He is alleging "malfeasance" by various former and current Scottish Government civil servants with his legal team arguing that they "conducted themselves improperly, in bad faith and beyond their powers, with the intention of injuring Mr Salmond".

They say this happened during a botched investigation carried out by civil servants over claims that the ex SNP leader acted inappropriately towards a number of women during his time in office.

On Friday, Mr Dangerfield told Lord Fairley that the Police Scotland investigation is called Operation Broadcroft and it is being headed by a senior detective.

The solicitor advocate, who once represented ex SSP leader Tommy Sheridan in court, told Lord Fairley that the investigation is looking at the alleged behaviour of Mr Hynd.

Mr Hynd was described in August 2020 as being the Scottish Government's head of Cabinet, Parliament and Governance.

Mr Dangerfield said: "I can advise that the ongoing Police Scotland investigation is named Operation Broadcroft. it is led by senior investigating officer Detective Superintendent Graham Lannigan.

"It arises from a criminal complaint by the pursuer covering precisely all of the malfeasance averred in the articles of condescence specified in the motion.

"The pursuer has been advised that the present focus of the investigation is on offences of wilfully making false statements on oath contrary to section 44 (1) of the Criminal Law Consolidation Scotland Act 1995.

"The pursuer anticipates however that this focus will broaden as the investigation proceeds and in due course cover his complaint covering the full range of criminality averred in these articles of condescendence.

"I would hope it would be evident to your lordship from a perusal of the averments that it would be a necessary course for the inquiry to follow - there's a very, very specific case that in my submission is self evident in these averments - that the head of cabinet - a very, very senior civil servant - Mr James Hynd - gave a false statement on oath at the inquiry.

"The evidence in the averments are very detailed and specific in the summons. I would be seeking to take your lordship to them because that constitutes a very, very specific and clear averment of crime and there is no doubt whatsoever that is presently being focused on by Operation Broadcroft because the pursuer has been specifically advised about that."

Mr Salmond won a judicial review in 2019 when the court found that the way a Scottish Government investigation into the allegations against him was handled was unlawful and "tainted with apparent bias".

A senior civil servant was appointed the investigating officer in the government inquiry, which started in early 2018, despite previously having contact with the two complainants.

The Scottish Government only conceded the judicial review case at the 11th hour, resulting in Mr Salmond being handed £512,250 of taxpayers' money to cover his legal costs.

The former SNP leader was cleared of 14 sexual assault charges in a separate criminal trial in 2020. He alleged at the time there was a conspiracy among senior SNP figures around ex first minister Nicola Sturgeon to imprison him.

Ms Sturgeon vigorously denied being part of a "cover-up" or "conspiracy", although she admitted the scandal had resulted in the breakdown of the relationship between her and the now Alba leader. She described this relationship as being "very important to me, politically and personally, for most of my life".

Among those named in the present action are Ms Sturgeon, his successor as SNP leader and first minister, and Leslie Evans, the Scottish Government's former permanent secretary.

Ms Sturgeon said she "utterly refutes" his claims.

Mr Salmond's lawyers claim they had taken part "in the criminal leaking of confidential documents, the concealment of documents in defiance of court orders and a criminal warrant, the misleading of the court during judicial review proceedings, the soliciting of false criminal complaints, and ultimately the commission of perjury at a parliamentary inquiry".

On Friday, Mr Dangerfield asked for the case to be "sisted" - a legal expression for it to be paused.

The court heard that if successful, this would be the fourth time the case would have been paused since being brought in November last year.

Mr Dangerfield said he wanted the case to be paused because of Operation Broadcroft.

He feared that the police investigation may uncover evidence which could disadvantage the officials at the centre of the Court of session action.

Lesley Shand KC, for the Scottish Government, urged Lord Fairley to reject the request for the sist to be extended.

She said: "Your lordship knows that it was raised in November 2023.

"It's been sisted three times already - once for another police investigation that came to nothing and here we are again - this is the fourth motion for a sist.

"There is a concern about the length of time has past since the events in question - there is a concern about the effect that will have on evidence and also on individuals who have this these allegations hanging over them in this summons.

"The fact of the matter is the onus is on the pursuer to demonstrate that it would be in the interests of justice for it to be delayed.

"in my submission, my learned friend, my friend has not reached the first hurdle of demonstrating this litigation causes a very specific and real risk to a prosecution and the conclusion of criminal proceedings - if there are ever criminal proceedings which is highly speculative."

Lord Fairley made reference to a legal judgment made recently by his colleague Lord Sandison.

In this opinion, Lord Sandison established a set of tests which lawyers need to meet in order to pause civil actions in cases where there is also potential criminal actions.

Lord Fairley said the circumstances of the present case didn't appear to meet the tests set out by Lord Sandison.

He refused the request to extend the sist.

He added: "If any stage during that process any party identifies a risk of prejudice to the police inquiry, parties are at liberty to bring the matter back before me to revisit the decision on whether or not there should be a decision for further procedure in this action - but for the moment I am completely unpersuaded by the mere fact of an on going police investigation; the outcome of which we simply cannot guess at comes anywhere close to meeting the test required to maintain a sist in place.

"For those reasons, i will refuse the motion to continue the sist and make an order for defences to be lodged within seven days."

Ms Shand moved for Mr Salmond to pay for the legal costs of today's hearing. Mr Dangerfield asked Lord Fairley to reserve expenses until the hearing was concluded.

Lord Fairley awarded expenses to Ms Shand and made reference to what happened in the run up to Friday's hearing.

He said: "Ms Shand has been successful. It seems to me that the pre motion correspondence about this was unnecessarily belligerent and unhelpful and if that had been conducted in a more responsible way it does not seem to me that this motion would have been necessary at all given what has been said today.

"So I am going to find Ms Shand entitled to her expenses.";
        
            Title: Birmingham make £10m bid for Premier League ace that will break transfer record; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/30165791/birmingham-fulham-jay-stansfield-transfer-record/; type: news; Description: BIRMINGHAM CITY have launched an ambitious £10million deadline day bid to sign Fulham striker Jay Stansfield.

The 21-year-old was a huge hit with Blues fans when he scored 13 goals while on loan last season.

Stansfield added another goal at St Andrews when he scored AGAINST Birmingham for Fulham in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday.

Blues boss Chris Davies is now hoping to smash the League One transfer record by paying more than double the £3.48m he paid for Christophe Klarer earlier in the window.

But according to the Telegraph reporter John Percy, the Cottagers have rejected the £10m bid from Birmingham for the striker.

The striker memorably scored a 95th-minute winner against Plymouth Argyle on his Championship debut for the club.

He then went on to make 47 appearances for Birmingham becoming a popular figure amongst the St Andrews faithful.

If Fulham decide to deal it would take Birmingham's spending to an eye-watering £24million in this window alone.

The Blues were relegated from the Championship last season after going through five managers including Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney.

And the club's new American ownership has done some big spending on the players and staff which made dropping into the third tier more heartbreaking.

With Stansfield's arrival, it seems the spending has not stopped with Birmingham desperate to make it back to the Championship for the first time of asking.

This summer they signed prolific striker Alfie May from Charlton, with the Blues paying £768,000 as an initial fee and a reported £16,000 salary to the player.

Centre-back Klarer arrived from German side Darmstadt, while Lyndon Dykes left Championship side QPR to move to St Andrews for £1 million.

Scott Wright has arrived from Rangers on deadline day, while a series of loan deals have been brokered.

Davies' side have won two and drawn one of their opening League One games this season.;

In this series, he captures images of his wife, Natalia Osmann, leading him by the hand through various stunning locations around the world.

Murad is a Russian photographer and social media influencer, born in Dagestan and later raised in Moscow.

He is widely recognised for his creative and visually captivating photography style, which merges travel, art and storytelling.

Murad's rise to fame began with his "Follow Me To" photo series, a project that he started in 2011 with his then-girlfriend (now wife), Natalia.

The series showcases Natalia leading Murad by the hand through some of the most beautiful and iconic locations around the world.

Murad's unique approach to travel photography has not only made him a social media sensation but also a globally-recognised name in the world of photography.

The #FollowMeTo Instagram trend was sparked by Murad's innovative photo series of the same name.

In each photograph, Murad captures a scene where his wife, Natalia, is shown from behind, holding his hand as she leads him to a new destination.

The images are characterised by stunning backdrops, whether it's a bustling cityscape, a serene beach or a historic landmark.

The trend quickly went viral, inspiring countless others to recreate the signature pose during their travels.

The hashtag #FollowMeTo has since become synonymous with adventure, exploration and the idea of shared experiences.

It's not just about the locations themselves, but about the journey and the relationship between the couple, which adds an emotional depth to the visuals.

Murad boasts a substantial following on Instagram, with over three million followers.

His account is a curated collection of his adventures around the world, offering a blend of breathtaking landscapes, cultural moments, and the iconic 'Follow Me To' series.

Although the series is primarily known for its photos, Murad extends this signature style to his videos, where he holds his wife's hand as she walks into stunning landscapes.

His massive following is a testament to his influence in the realms of travel and photography, making him one of the most recognised figures in these fields.

Murad and his wife, Natalia, are parents to two children.

The couple welcomed their first child, a son, in 2019.

In 2023, Murad announced the birth of his second son on Instagram with a snap of the baby's little feet.

He captioned the post: "Welcome to this world. Can you suggest your top 3 names for our baby boy?"

While Murad is known for sharing his travels and adventures on social media, he and Natalia have chosen to keep their children's lives relatively private, only occasionally sharing glimpses of their family life.;

X, formerly known as Twitter, has said it expects to be blocked in Brazil after failing to meet a deadline to name a new legal representative for the company. The social media network closed its office in the country earlier this month, saying its representative had been threatened with arrest if she did not comply with orders it described as "censorship".

Donald Trump has warned that Mark Zuckerberg will "spend the rest of his life in prison" if Facebook illegally influences the outcome of the US presidential election. In a book to be published next week, Trump alleged that the billionaire tech chief "steered" Facebook against him during the 2020 campaign. Trump claimed in the book, titled Save America, that Mr Zuckerberg would visit the Oval Office and "bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be", while engaging in a "plot against the president".

A few hours ago iFixit published its teardown video of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and now the same phone has been subjected to a similar treatment by Zack at JerryRigEverything. The device is opened from the back using heat and isopropyl alcohol. From the get-go repairs seem slightly hindered by the use of less common screws in some parts. And there are also multiple sizes of screws, which can complicate the reassembly process even further.

The battery removal process is quite bad, as has also been evidenced in the other video. The pull tab basically breaks without doing its job, so you need to use alcohol to dissolve the very strong adhesive. GSM Arena;

Many Roman shoppers have already bought the Black Floral Pocket Stretch Midi Dress, with it boasting a fabulous overall rating of 4.9 out of five. One delighted buyer wrote: "Perfect, versatile dress. I've worn it out to lunch, to a wedding and with a sweatshirt. Love the pockets."

A second commented: "Beautiful style. A high waisted design which flows over the hips, it's so slimming. If like me you can't wear anything that gathers on the waist (big hips), this dress is the answer. The material is lovely, the fit is fab, the length perfect. I have three of these dresses in different materials. Suits all occasions. My buy of the year - happy customer."

A third said: "I love it. Smart, flattering and good quality. I look forward to wearing it through Autumn into Winter."

Another simply added: "Very comfortable and flattering dress. True to size."

Sadly some shoppers found the dress was too long on them, with one explaining: "Very pretty dress, a simple style and very comfortable to wear. I am 5ft 5" and found it too long for a midi dress, but it was easily shortened."

The site of the proposed play area is located on an informal grassland meadow recreation area to the northwest of the visitor centre, using Robinia hardwood logs and sawn timber, ropes and hand-woven nets manufactured using steel reinforced polypropylene, with the appearance of traditional hemp cordage, the applicants say.

A supporting statement accompanying the application says the design proposal, produced by Earth Wrights Ltd, is about "increasing play value and creating a place inclusive for everyone".

"Once the vision was clarified, the play area was designed with the key objectives of enhancing the existing informal recreation space and increasing opportunities for different types of play.

"The proposed play area will comprise a variety of timber play equipment, with interconnecting ropes and hand-woven nets, to provide a range of play activities for children of all ages. The play equipment will be constructed of natural materials, using durable, Robinia logs and sawn timber.

"The proposed play area will be small scale, extending to 100 square metres in surface area and just 2m in height, ensuring that the timber play equipment will be visually unobtrusive with no adverse impacts on the local landscape or visual amenity of the area.

"The additional visitors and users of the play equipment would generate minimal and localised noise impacts, confined to the Welsh Wildlife Centre complex itself, with no impacts upon residential properties or other sensitive receptors, given the extensive separation distances to neighbouring development."

The application will be considered by county planners at a later date.;
        
            Title: Republic seeking legal advice over trade with Israel; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.irishnews.com/news/ireland/republic-seeking-legal-advice-over-trade-with-israel-JKCTHWFUCNEJDMIO335UOIAHPA/; type: news; Description: The leaders of the Republic's three coalition parties decided on Thursday that the State would not procure any further defence equipment from Israel.

The Taoiseach is seeking legal advice over trade with Israel.

While noting that international trade policy is an EU competency, Simon Harris said he was writing to Attorney General Rossa Fanning for "fresh legal advice" on the domestic possibilities.

Mr Harris said that "every lever" must be pulled to maximise pressure on the Israeli government to bring forward a cessation of violence in Gaza.

The leaders of the Republic's three coalition parties decided on Thursday that the State would not procure any further defence or military equipment and contracts from Israel.

Speaking on Friday, Mr Harris said the action was "appropriate" in line with rulings of the International Court of Justice.

In July, the UN's top court declared Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories unlawful - and called for settlement construction to stop immediately.

Mr Harris said: "I think it's really important when an international court makes substantive findings, that those findings are given effect in every way."

He characterised it as a "further step" after the Republic had recognised Palestinian statehood, voted to support Palestine's membership of the UN and increased humanitarian aid to the region.

Under EU treaties and common commercial policy, the European Commission represents the Republic and all other member states in international trade negotiations.

However, Mr Harris said the decision around suspending imports of defence equipment currently is "legally possible".

He added that he was seeking further advice on other trade matters from the State's top legal adviser.

He told Newstalk radio: "Today, I'm going to write to the Attorney General and I'm going to seek fresh legal advice in relation to the entire matter of trade in the context of the most recent International Court of Justice ruling.

"Because it has been the absolute clear legal advice from successive attorneys general that trade is a European competency."

He said the Republic was continuing to call for an urgent review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement as he said human rights clauses in the trade pact were being breached.

"Human rights clauses aren't in there to pad out the document - they have to have real meaning and real effect.

"I make this point to every European president and prime minister I meet, and will continue to advocate for that.";

President Biden withdrew from the race for the White House in July after weeks of scrutiny over his age and fitness, most notably after a disastrous debate showing against Donald Trump.

Ms Harris, who is serving as his vice president, had backed Mr Biden to continue until that point and said it has been an "honour" to serve in his administration.

"He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgement and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president," she told CNN.

"By contrast, the former president has none of that."

Mr Trump appeared to respond to the interview, posting "BORING!!!" on his platform Truth Social, having earlier said he looks forward to debating her and "exposing her for the fraud she is".

Analysis:

Harris scrutinised at last

In her first mainstream media interview since being named as the Democrat nominee, Ms Harris revealed she was about to work on a puzzle with her young nieces when Mr Biden called.

"The phone rang and it was Joe Biden and he told me what he had decided to do and I asked him, 'are you sure?' And he said 'yes' and that's how I learned about it," she said.

She said he was "very clear" he was going to endorse her, but she said her first thought was about him.

'My values haven't changed'

Ms Harris also insisted her values "have not changed" despite pivoting more towards the centre on certain policies.

She has toughened her position on migration along the southern US border with Mexico and no longer wants a ban on fracking, an energy production method employing many in the key state of Pennsylvania.

"My value around what we need to do to secure our border - that value has not changed," she said.

"I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting trans-national criminal organisations, violations of American laws, regarding the illegal passage of guns, drugs and human beings across our border.

On foreign affairs, she said a ceasefire and hostage release deal is needed in Gaza, while she reiterated support for Israel and maintained "too many innocent Palestinians have been killed".

"Israel has a right to defend itself... and how it does so matters," she said.

"Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, and we have got to get a deal done."

She did not offer any change in the current status quo policy.

Republican in cabinet

She also discussed the possibility of adding a Republican to her potential cabinet, adding she wanted a diversity of opinion.

"I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences," she said.

"And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican."

She said there was "no one particular" in mind for the potential role.

'Next question please'

Turning attention back to Mr Trump, Ms Harris was asked about his claim the multicultural Democrat only recently began identifying as black.

"Same old tired playbook," said Ms Harris, whose mother was born in India and father in Jamaica.

"Next question, please."

She has long embraced the totality of her identity and graduated from Howard University, a historically black institution.;
        
            Title: Spencer Matthews reveals huge six figure sum he's raised for charity; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13450816/spencer-matthews-six-figure-sum-charity-marathons/; type: news; Description: Listen to Spencer talking to The Sun about his challenge in the video above

SPENCER Matthews has revealed the staggering amount he's raised for charity after completing a record-breaking endurance challenge.

The TV star ran 30 marathons in 30 days across the Jordanian desert in aid of Global's Make Some Noise, which supports small charities across the UK.

So far, the tally is a seriously impressive £512,000k and looks set to grow even further now he's back in the UK.

Appearing on Heart Breakfast today, he said: "That's insane. To be honest, the whole time that I was out there running, the charities were such a massive driver for me.

"And, as I said earlier, the support and the generosity shown throughout the challenge was completely overwhelming. And even just the messages on socials, I've never felt anything like that level of support for anything in my life.

"So, I can't thank you all enough. You know, I see this very much as - we only just finished this, I'm hoping for another few weeks of fundraising now. I'm going to think about ways to continue to raise money for these incredible causes and the great work that Global's Make Some Noise do.

"So, if you haven't yet donated, please consider donating, all your money makes such a big difference to incredible families and children who really deserve the help, so please consider it."

The desert challenge pushed Spencer to the limit and his body changed dramatically between the first marathon and the last - some 1,274km in total.

He spoke to us from the desert prior to breaking the record and revealed how he would spend his days after crossing the line.

"Life just needs to go back to normal for a bit, I think, before considering anything else," he said. "I've really missed pizza. I can't wait to have a pizza and a nice cold shower. A normal bed with some air conditioning would be nice."

He reunited with his adoring wife Vogue Williams and their two eldest children - Theo and Gigi - at the finish line.

The trio gave him a hero's welcome and lots of kisses and cuddles as he completed his goal close to the Dead Sea.

As unthinkably difficult as the gruelling feat of endurance was, it paled in comparison to the grim conditions he experienced between runs.

However, Spencer's smile was unwavering as he recalled eating flesh from a boiled goat's head, battling swarms of flies and sleeping on sweat-soaked mats.

He said: "The biggest low, I suppose, is that it's Groundhog Day. It's exactly the same every single day.

"The marathon has actually become my favourite part of the day because the rest of it is at the best of times pretty grim."

Each day a camp of sorts was erected close to the end of the planned route - though they were all far removed from the sites you may pitch up in around the British Isles.

He continued: "By camp, I mean a covering like a tent, no air conditioning, no toilets, no running water, rough grounds.

"We each have a mat. They are fluffy and furry. In 40 plus degrees [Celsius], they're not very comfortable.

"You lie on them with as few clothes on as possible because it's very, very hot. You sweat profusely into your mats on a daily basis."

Holding up the mat to camera, Spencer explained it's about two metres by 50 centimetres and not too dissimilar to a lilo.

"You eat on those. You relax on those. You sleep on those. You nap on those. That's where you spend the bulk of your day. About 18 hours a day you spend in camp. Obviously, you sleep in that time as well."

Sleep was difficult to come by at times, with Spencer getting as little as two hours of shut-eye some nights before having to get up and run another marathon.

Though he found little sympathy, telling me: "No one gives a sh*t if you sleep for two hours."

The sheer scale of the desert and its remoteness surprised him, with up to 100km between towns and villages, while the local cuisine was of an acquired taste meaning he went hungry for long periods of time.

"It's not like there is nothing in these towns," he said. "We've come across the odd chicken shop that's all right, but there's nothing. There's no supermarkets.

"It's quite a difficult place to exist unless you're from here. It's certainly very new to us. We were served a goat's head for dinner, which of course is an interesting dish, but it was a goat's head that was boiled and then put on a tray with some rice around it.

"That's it. You're just picking its face off its skull and eating it. I'm starving a lot of the time.

"I don't want to make it sound like a terrible experience because it's been one of the best experiences of my life. Camp is something I hadn't really accounted for. It is not nice."

The camp conditions were so bad that Spencer banned Vogue and their kids from joining him days ahead of the finish.

"This is no place for kids," he said.

"Vogue would last less than five minutes in one of these camps. That's no poor reflection on her. It's deeply unpleasant.

"Contrast that with the earlier camps in Wadi Rum Desert. Insane, amazing, no flies, beautiful, canyons, sunsets, sunrises, insane stars, shooting stars. All that's been gone for a little while now."

It was the relentless harassment from flies that proved particularly troublesome deep into the challenge.

"There's a real fly issue in some camps if you're near a plantation," he said. "I don't know what they do, by the way, like grow or whatever, but they call them plantations.

"I mean you're racing around outside, eating your food. If you sat still, there'd be all of your food all over you.

"You can't nap because you're just repeatedly slapping yourself in the face to get rid of them. It doesn't sound like it would be a big issue, but I actually can't tell you the level of frustration that comes with these flies.

"They disappear at 6.30pm on the dot. It's like they're late for something. They literally just vanish."

The military precision of the whole operation, which was eight months in the making, is what Spencer credits with helping to keep that smile on his face, as well as the knowledge that his efforts were raising a huge sum of money for Global's Make Some Noise charity, which helps people all over the UK.

He was also joined by a stellar team without which the challenge would not have come to fruition. Those men are running coach Chris Taylor, physio Jonny Heath, Dr. Joshua Alisson, and videographer Matt Stone.

Then there was guest runner, celebrity chef and founder of British butter company All Things Butter, Thomas Straker, who decided to join Spencer for the 22nd leg of his Great Desert Challenge after an encounter at his West London restaurant earlier in the year.

The slick plan was also responsible for Spencer receiving messages from some awestruck followers who claimed he was making it look easy.

"I personally don't think that these challenges have to revolve around pain and misery and jeopardy," said Spencer. "Jeopardy is the antithesis of good preparation.

"If you're well prepared for something, in an ideal world, there won't be any jeopardy. I'm getting a few messages saying, you're making this look really easy. It's good.

"That means I'm doing a really good job. When I get a message like that, it just makes me think the team are professional, the plan is working.

"Every day is the same, but we are grinding through a plan that we created earlier this year. This challenge for me started in January. This isn't a 30-day thing.

"I've been getting as prepared as I humanly can be to succeed. I don't want to come out here and fail. So I've done everything I can to make sure that I don't."

Among the supportive messages he received was one from 'The Hardest Geezer', Russ Cook, who earlier this year became the first person to run the entire length of Africa.

It meant a lot as Spencer had followed Russ's Africa run with interest and was impressed by his mental fortitude.

"I think I engaged with Russ's efforts more because of his energy," said Spencer. "Obviously, his athletic achievement was crazy as well, but the thing that I was more taken by with him was his enthusiasm for life.

"His general nature made me very interested in him as a person, instead of what he could have been doing. I'm sure he had tons of issues along the way, but he chose to focus on energetic, positive messaging.

"Which is exactly how I would want to be in this situation, and I think how I have been."

The driven family man Spencer is today is unrecognisable from his 20-something self.

Back then he was a party-loving Made In Chelsea star who had an alcohol problem so severe that he could have died had he not taken drastic action.

These days he runs the successful non-alcoholic beverage brand Clean Co. and very rarely drinks.

"Running's really changed my life," he said. "I've come a really, really long way from where I was a few years ago. I'm really proud of myself, which is a beautiful feeling to have.

"I've lived for many years in shame of my own behaviour and my own actions. So, to feel like I've come out of that and, touch wood, all being well, have managed to achieve this completely unprecedented, wild task will be a new chapter in my life.

"I really don't know what will come of it, but there will be more of it, I think, because I think I'm pretty good at it. It's a nice thing to feel sometimes."

Though he's no stranger to endurance events having already completed the Marathon des Sables and a Jungle Ultra Marathon, Spencer believes this record-breaking feat could spur him on to even greater achievements.

He said: "I've really loved this, the adventurous side of it and the pushing yourself to extreme limits. I hope it inspires some other people to start running or increase their velocity of running or their distance or their mileage and push themselves to do that thing that they might feel is impossible. Because I can tell you that from where I was to where I am now, I believe that anything is possible at this stage.

"I find it really annoying when people say, anything is possible, but I can't tell you where I was five or six years ago compared to now. So, I do feel like with a bit of dedication, hard work and action, you can really make positive change in your life. I hope this inspires somebody to go out there and do something cool."

There's no doubt he has achieved that goal and then some.

Farming Outlook will air weekly on Sundays. The show will be live from 6am to 9am, before repeating in the evening from 7pm to 10pm.

After the show, a shorter highlights version will be uploaded to streaming platforms and hosted on the Farming Outlook website https://farmingoutlook.co.uk/

The 12-week pilot will see radio visit farmers to discuss innovation, skills, wellbeing and environmental opportunities across the region.

Great Yorkshire Radio is producing the show on its Coast & County station, which follows the success of the original pilot that aired in spring.

The programme will be broadcasted on 97.4FM in Whitby, Ryedale, Scarborough and Filey, on DAB and online at www.coastandcountyradio.co.uk/radioplayer/.

Grow Yorkshire, an initiative led by York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority, is working in partnership with the Yorkshire Agricultural Society and the Country Land and Business Association on the show.

David Skaith, mayor of York and North Yorkshire, said: "York and North Yorkshire's farmers already lead the way in many aspects. We have high standards of food production but we're also ambitious on the environment.

"With more than 70% of our area used for agriculture, farming has a big part to play in our ambition to become carbon negative by 2040.

"This initiative can play a part in connecting our farmers with information and support in learning about innovative methods to reduce carbon emissions and also capture carbon".

North Yorkshire Council has provided £20,000 in funding for the programme through the Government's Shared Prosperity Fund. Councillor Carl Les, leader of North Yorkshire Council and chair of the Shared Prosperity Fund Local Partnership Group, said:

"It's really encouraging to see this radio programme extended for another few months following a successful pilot earlier in the year.

"Farmers across North Yorkshire are keen to embrace new technology to improve production and reduce carbon emissions and this programme will support that through discussions with experts and fellow farmers.

"The Shared Prosperity Fund aims to invest in our communities and this project is an excellent way to connect our rural populations and support local agricultural businesses which form the bedrock of our rural economy.";

Three medicated sheep were burgled from the village of Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, over the Bank Holiday weekend, say West Mercia Police.

Shoppers are urged to stick to reputably sourced meat, as the sheep in question are unfit for human consumption due to the medication they were on.

Although the incident took place in Worcestershire, police also extended the warning to residents across Herefordshire and Shropshire.

PCSO Kate Easthope said: "We're concerned that if the meat from these sheep has entered the food chain it could cause serious health issues for those who consume it.

"As always, for your safety we would only advise buying and consuming meat from reputable sources.

"As well as being unsafe for consumers, illegal butchery is a serious offence which can cause unnecessary suffering to the animal. Rural crimes like this also have serious emotional and financial impact on our farming communities.

"We've launched an investigation into this incident and I would ask, as always, that people contact us if they think someone is selling illegal meat."

The news comes after a similar incident earlier this year, in which two Reading businesses were found in possession of 400kg of illegal meat products.

The meat, which included sheep heads, cutlets, leg joints and offal - some of which was more than a year old - was found to be in breach of food hygiene standards.

Two weeks ago, the National Sheep Association (NSA) also warned of an "alarming rise" in illegal sheep meat imports - with sheep being transported from abroad without adequate checks.

NSA chief executive Phil Stocker said this could introduce new diseases to the UK food system, and urged the Labour government to roll out "swift and effective measures."

Anyone with information about the theft of the sheep, or who may have been offered meat for sale in the last few days which may be suspicious, is asked to contact PSCO Kate Easthope on 07773046202 or kate.easthope@westmercia.police.uk quoting incident number 453i of 25 August.;
        
            Title: Inside the secret Buckingham Palace rooms & how royals use hidden passageways; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/royals/13450764/secret-passageway-rat-problem-secrets-buckingham-palace/; type: news; Description: Watch our clip to see how the Buckingham Palace secret passageways work

IT'S one of the most recognisable buildings in Britain, but Buckingham Palace has many secrets behind its elaborate walls.

With its own private pool and cinema, it has many fascinating features available for the royal family and staff members.

However, while you'd imagine a glittering palace to be the height of luxury, there are also reports of it being cold and having rats over the years.

Here we lift the lid on the iconic London landmark and reveal some hidden facts...

There are a whopping 775 rooms in Buckingham Palace - so it's hardly surprising that the royal family have clever ways of getting round quickly and away from the public.

It turns out that there are secret passageways to help with the issue, including one hidden behind a huge mirror.

In a segment on ITV's Good Morning Britain filmed in 2015, Kate Garraway gave viewers a tour of the grand White Drawing Room.

As she stopped to admire the huge mirror in the middle of the room, Kate revealed that it actually hides a secret door so the royals can make a surprise entrance to their private apartments.

Anna Reynolds, curator of the Royal Collection True, previously said: "This is the way to the Queen's apartments.

"It allows her to make an entrance without having to walk through all of the different palace rooms."

King Charles' former butler Grant Harrold said: "I remember once watching The Queen walking towards what I thought was a mirror and thinking, 'what is she going to do?'

"She walked up to it and it opened and through she went."

"It looks for a minute as if railway tracks are going down."

She then spoke to a staff member, who told her: "It's for the Buckingham Palace cinema.

"All the people who work here come along. It's Judy tonight if you want to stay."

Forget having to pop to the post office after work, as staff can take advantage of Buckingham Palace's very own Post Office.

Just like many rooms and facilities on offer at the palace, all 800 palace staff can make use of the Court Post Office, which is run by Royal Mail.

While we can't be certain of how it looks now, a snap from 1941 offers a sneak peak into what it was like all those years ago.

Luckily for the royal family, withdrawing cash in a hurry is no obstacle.

In 2001, the now-former head of Coutts bank, Gordon Pell, confirmed to The Standard that there is indeed an ATM inside Buckingham Palace.

The late Queen's former press secretary Ailsa Anderson confirmed that it doesn't charge you for using it.

The palace also has doctor's surgery if any royal family members or staff need immediate care.

The Royal Mews Surgery is located at Buckingham Palace and is run by the late Queen's GP, Dr Timothy Evans.

But it mostly offers NHS healthcare to royal household staff as the royal family prefers to be treated privately.

Even though it's one of the most famous buildings in the world, Buckingham Palace has allegedly been dealing with a rodent problem since the 1830s.

Opening up about the Palace's rat residents, Professor Kate Williams said: "When Queen Victoria moved to Buckingham Palace, she was shocked by how many rats there were.

"Rats treated Buckingham Palace like their own personal playground.

"It got so bad that Victoria had to appoint her own rat-catcher and his title was Jack Black VR - rat and mole catcher to Her Majesty."

Unfortunately, the expert wasn't able to exterminate the rats completely and the historian said the Queen Mother used to practise shooting on the rodents during WWII.

Kate added: "She was practising what to do in case Hitler invaded and she was kidnapped - she got a gun and she used to shoot them in this crumpled part of Buckingham Palace [...]

"As recently as 2019, exterminators were called in because rats were seen tearing through the royal kitchens."

You may wish to wrap up warm if you ever get a chance to go inside Buckingham Palace in winter.

The heating has reportedly been turned down inside the building and at other royal homes, to reflect King Charles' views on saving energy.

According to the Independent, royal family members, staff and guests live in temperatures set at 19C during the winter and a few degrees lower when rooms are empty.;

EPIC Games Store gives away free games every week, but this week includes a bumper crop.

There are four games up for grabs instead of the usual one or two, making this an incredible deal.

Of the four games available this month three are from the Fallout series, and are considered by many to be some of the series' best games.

Fallout has received a lot of attention recently because of the popularity of the Fallout TV show, so this is a great way to discover more about the in-game universe.

This week, PC gamers can pick up the Fallout Classic Collection, which includes three games from the series.

In one download, players can pick up the original Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel.

Unlike the modern Fallout games, these are top-down games that focus on the skill trees, choices, and branching narratives the series is known for.

While more recent games in the series focus on combat, the classic games put far more emphasis on the story elements.

For those focused on the series combat, Fallout Tactics covers this part of the series.

The Fallout Classic Collection usually costs £15.99/$19.99, so you can save quite a bit of money by picking it up this week.

There is another game that people can pick up Wild Card Football for free this week.

This is a 7v7 American football simulator that includes special power-ups and rule-breaking abilities to shake up the gameplay.

While less well known than the Fallout games, Wild Card Football usually costs £24.99/$29.99, which is an even bigger saving.

Both games can be downloaded for free until Thursday, September 5, 2024, after which there will be two different free games up for grabs.

Next week players can pick up Football Manager 24 and Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts to add to their collections.

If you want to download the Fallout Classic Collection or Wild Card Football, you can do so via the Epic Games Store website or directly via the Epic Games Store launcher.

The launcher is free to download and you'll need it if you want to play the games, so it is worth picking up.

The Duke of Sussex was initially expected to miss the service, which took place in Norfolk on Wednesday due to security concerns but "discreetly" travelled to the UK in order to attend the funeral alongside his older brother.

According to reports, the two princes sat apart at the back of St Mary's Church after arriving in a very discreet manner.

The last time that William and Harry were in the same room together was at King Charles' Coronation back in May 2023, the Express reports.

Speaking of the reunion earlier this week, a local told The Sun: "William and Harry were both there but we never saw them speak to each other and they were keeping their distance."

Despite his strained relationship with the Prince of Wales, Harry is said to be missing his sister-in-law Kate Middleton and wants to "catch up with her and see how everything is".

Speaking to OK!, an expert said: "With Harry's birthday fast approaching, he has been speaking about maybe reaching out to Kate because it's on milestones like this when he really misses her. She helped plan his 30th birthday and he feels bad that she won't be involved and would love to catch up with her and see how everything is."

Harry will celebrate his 40th birthday in just a few weeks time on September 15.

            Title: Cops probing civil servant over 'false statement' during Alex Salmond inquiry; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-probing-senior-civil-servant-33567997; type: news; Description: Police are probing whether a senior civil servant "gave a false statement under oath" to an inquiry set up to investigate sexual misconduct allegations involving Alex Salmond, a court heard.

Lawyer Gordon Dangerfield told a Court of Session hearing on Friday that detectives are probing the alleged conduct of James Hynd.

Mr Dangerfield is representing the former First Minister in an action which he has brought against the Scottish Government.

Mr Salmond is seeking "significant damages" and compensation for loss of earnings that could total millions of pounds from Ministers.

He is alleging "malfeasance" by various former and current Scottish Government civil servants with his legal team arguing that they "conducted themselves improperly, in bad faith and beyond their powers, with the intention of injuring Mr Salmond".

They say this happened during a botched investigation carried out by civil servants over claims that the ex SNP leader acted inappropriately towards a number of women during his time in office.

On Friday, Mr Dangerfield told Lord Fairley that the Police Scotland investigation is called Operation Broadcroft and it is being headed by a senior detective.

The solicitor advocate, who once represented ex SSP leader Tommy Sheridan in court, told Lord Fairley that the investigation is looking at the alleged behaviour of Mr Hynd.

Mr Hynd was described in August 2020 as being the Scottish Government's head of Cabinet, Parliament and Governance.

Mr Dangerfield said: "I can advise that the ongoing Police Scotland investigation is named Operation Broadcroft. it is led by senior investigating officer Detective Superintendent Graham Lannigan.

"It arises from a criminal complaint by the pursuer covering precisely all of the malfeasance averred in the articles of condescence specified in the motion.

"The pursuer has been advised that the present focus of the investigation is on offences of wilfully making false statements on oath contrary to section 44 (1) of the Criminal Law Consolidation Scotland Act 1995.

"The pursuer anticipates however that this focus will broaden as the investigation proceeds and in due course cover his complaint covering the full range of criminality averred in these articles of condescendence.

"I would hope it would be evident to your lordship from a perusal of the averments that it would be a necessary course for the inquiry to follow - there's a very, very specific case that in my submission is self evident in these averments - that the head of cabinet - a very, very senior civil servant - Mr James Hynd - gave a false statement on oath at the inquiry.

"The evidence in the averments are very detailed and specific in the summons. I would be seeking to take your lordship to them because that constitutes a very, very specific and clear averment of crime and there is no doubt whatsoever that is presently being focused on by Operation Broadcroft because the pursuer has been specifically advised about that."

Mr Salmond won a judicial review in 2019 when the court found that the way a Scottish Government investigation into the allegations against him was handled was unlawful and "tainted with apparent bias".

A senior civil servant was appointed the investigating officer in the government inquiry, which started in early 2018, despite previously having contact with the two complainants.

The Scottish Government only conceded the judicial review case at the 11th hour, resulting in Mr Salmond being handed £512,250 of taxpayers' money to cover his legal costs.

The former SNP leader was cleared of 14 sexual assault charges in a separate criminal trial in 2020. He alleged at the time there was a conspiracy among senior SNP figures around ex first minister Nicola Sturgeon to imprison him.

Ms Sturgeon vigorously denied being part of a "cover-up" or "conspiracy", although she admitted the scandal had resulted in the breakdown of the relationship between her and the now Alba leader. She described this relationship as being "very important to me, politically and personally, for most of my life".

Among those named in the present action are Ms Sturgeon, his successor as SNP leader and first minister, and Leslie Evans, the Scottish Government's former permanent secretary.

Ms Sturgeon said she "utterly refutes" his claims.

Mr Salmond's lawyers claim they had taken part "in the criminal leaking of confidential documents, the concealment of documents in defiance of court orders and a criminal warrant, the misleading of the court during judicial review proceedings, the soliciting of false criminal complaints, and ultimately the commission of perjury at a parliamentary inquiry".

On Friday, Mr Dangerfield asked for the case to be "sisted" - a legal expression for it to be paused.

The court heard that if successful, this would be the fourth time the case would have been paused since being brought in November last year.

Mr Dangerfield said he wanted the case to be paused because of Operation Broadcroft.

He feared that the police investigation may uncover evidence which could disadvantage the officials at the centre of the Court of session action.

Lesley Shand KC, for the Scottish Government, urged Lord Fairley to reject the request for the sist to be extended.

She said: "Your lordship knows that it was raised in November 2023.

"It's been sisted three times already - once for another police investigation that came to nothing and here we are again - this is the fourth motion for a sist.

"There is a concern about the length of time has past since the events in question - there is a concern about the effect that will have on evidence and also on individuals who have this these allegations hanging over them in this summons.

"The fact of the matter is the onus is on the pursuer to demonstrate that it would be in the interests of justice for it to be delayed.

"in my submission, my learned friend, my friend has not reached the first hurdle of demonstrating this litigation causes a very specific and real risk to a prosecution and the conclusion of criminal proceedings - if there are ever criminal proceedings which is highly speculative."

Lord Fairley made reference to a legal judgment made recently by his colleague Lord Sandison.

In this opinion, Lord Sandison established a set of tests which lawyers need to meet in order to pause civil actions in cases where there is also potential criminal actions.

Lord Fairley said the circumstances of the present case didn't appear to meet the tests set out by Lord Sandison.

He refused the request to extend the sist.

He added: "If any stage during that process any party identifies a risk of prejudice to the police inquiry, parties are at liberty to bring the matter back before me to revisit the decision on whether or not there should be a decision for further procedure in this action - but for the moment I am completely unpersuaded by the mere fact of an on going police investigation; the outcome of which we simply cannot guess at comes anywhere close to meeting the test required to maintain a sist in place.

"For those reasons, i will refuse the motion to continue the sist and make an order for defences to be lodged within seven days."

Ms Shand moved for Mr Salmond to pay for the legal costs of today's hearing. Mr Dangerfield asked Lord Fairley to reserve expenses until the hearing was concluded.

Lord Fairley awarded expenses to Ms Shand and made reference to what happened in the run up to Friday's hearing.

He said: "Ms Shand has been successful. It seems to me that the pre motion correspondence about this was unnecessarily belligerent and unhelpful and if that had been conducted in a more responsible way it does not seem to me that this motion would have been necessary at all given what has been said today.

"So I am going to find Ms Shand entitled to her expenses."

The organisation is on the hunt to find a EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker winner who has yet to claim their £1,000,000 prize from the special draw held on Friday, August 16.

According to The National Lottery, the ticket for the unclaimed prize was bought in Cardiff. In every draw, the EuroMillions Millionaire Maker guarantees to create a millionaire, but in the special draw on August 16, ten UK millionaires were created and one lucky winner has yet to claim their prize.

Cardiff players are now being encouraged to double-check their unique EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker code from the special draw, as they might be in with the chance of becoming an instant millionaire. The winning code for this prize was HGSB 20321 and the fortunate ticket-holder has until February 12, 2025 to claim their prize.

According to The National Lottery, for every EuroMillions line played, UK players automatically receive a EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker code printed on their ticket.

Andy Carter, the senior winners' advisor at The National Lottery, said: "This prize is the last one that is yet to be claimed from the special EuroMillions draw. If you bought a EuroMillions ticket in Cardiff for the draw on 16 August, it's time to look everywhere! Have a rummage through the pockets of clothes, bags, in the car, wallets and purses, and down the side of the sofa, just make sure to check those tickets.

We're desperate to find this mystery ticket-holder and pay out their life-changing prize - imagine being a millionaire and not even knowing it! We have the champagne on ice and our fingers crossed that the lucky winner comes forward to claim their win."

According to The National Lottery, if the winning ticket isn't claimed before the prize claim deadline, the prize money and all the interest it has generated will be used to support National Lottery-funded projects across the UK. For all National Lottery draws, players have 180 days from the day of the draw to claim their prize if they hold the winning ticket.

            Title: Birmingham make £10m bid for Premier League ace that will break transfer record; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/13450844/birmingham-fulham-jay-stansfield-transfer-record/; type: news; Description: BIRMINGHAM CITY have launched an ambitious £10million deadline day bid to sign Fulham striker Jay Stansfield.

The 21-year-old was a huge hit with Blues fans when he scored 13 goals while on loan last season.

Stansfield added another goal at St Andrews when he scored AGAINST Birmingham for Fulham in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday.

Blues boss Chris Davies is now hoping to smash the League One transfer record by paying more than double the £3.48m he paid for Christophe Klarer earlier in the window.

But according to the Telegraph reporter John Percy, the Cottagers have rejected the £10m bid from Birmingham for the striker.

The striker memorably scored a 95th-minute winner against Plymouth Argyle on his Championship debut for the club.

He then went on to make 47 appearances for Birmingham becoming a popular figure amongst the St Andrews faithful.

If Fulham decide to deal it would take Birmingham's spending to an eye-watering £24million in this window alone.

The Blues were relegated from the Championship last season after going through five managers including Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney.

And the club's new American ownership has done some big spending on the players and staff which made dropping into the third tier more heartbreaking.

With Stansfield's arrival, it seems the spending has not stopped with Birmingham desperate to make it back to the Championship for the first time of asking.

This summer they signed prolific striker Alfie May from Charlton, with the Blues paying £768,000 as an initial fee and a reported £16,000 salary to the player.

Centre-back Klarer arrived from German side Darmstadt, while Lyndon Dykes left Championship side QPR to move to St Andrews for £1 million.

Scott Wright has arrived from Rangers on deadline day, while a series of loan deals have been brokered.

Davies' side have won two and drawn one of their opening League One games this season.;

            Title: Unexpectedly healthy BTL activity kept lenders busy this August - Armstrong; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/better-business/2024/08/30/unexpectedly-healthy-btl-activity-kept-lenders-busy-this-august-armstrong/; type: news; Description: The mortgage market has been anything but usual, as the lull we'd expect to see in August has simply not materialised.

We've seen good volumes of activity throughout the month for brokers and lenders alike, largely driven by the base rate reduction seen at the start of the month.

At a local level, I have seen an influx of properties being put up for sale in my neighbourhood and surrounding areas, giving the purchase market a much-needed boost. I've been asked if this is because landlords are selling up, but my feeling is no.

I'm not seeing anything to suggest a mass landlord exodus, but I do believe that some savvy landlords are looking hard at their portfolios and taking this opportunity to get rid of any underperforming properties or those that need additional work to bring them up to standard.

Let's visit some of the changes that lenders have been making in the last few weeks.

Landbay has brought back its automated valuation model (AVM) products to help save clients time, valuation fees and solicitor fees. These are available up to 75% loan to value (LTV), an increase on the previous 70% LTV.

Its two-year fixed AVMs are available for both portfolio and non-portfolio landlords, while the five-year fixed products are only available for non-portfolio applicants. AVM rates start at 3.74% for a standard two-year fix up to 70% LTV with a 6% product fee. For all AVM products, the maximum property value is £750,000, maximum six storeys in block and the lease must be greater than 85 years at completion. Houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) and multi-unit freehold blocks (MUFBs) are excluded, along with builds, self-builds and developed properties.

Fleet Mortgages announced a 35 basis point (bps) rate reduction to its 75% LTV, five-year fixed HMO product with a 3% fee, resulting in an initial rate of 5.54%. The lender also introduced a two-year fixed HMO product that is available up to 75% LTV with a fixed fee of £1,999, and it is priced at 6.49%.

Rental calculations for standard-rate taxpayers and limited company applicants on HMO and MUFB products have been adjusted and are increasing from 125% and initial rate to 130% and initial rate.

Paragon has launched some brand two- and five-year fixes in its buy-to-let (BTL) switch and further advance ranges. Following rate reductions across the board, switch products now start from 4.85% and further advance products from 5.89%. The 4.85% switch rate is for a two-year fixed product up to 75% LTV with a fee of 3%.

A zero-fee option is also available, priced at 6.35%. The five-year fixed rates start at 5.29% up to 75% LTV with a 3% fee.

Buy to Let by Foundation reduced its core BTL range by up to 30bps. Included in this are its F1 two- and five-year fixed EPC Saver products, which saw reductions of 10bps. Rates now start from 5.84% up to 75% LTV, including a free EPC Plus report and £1,000 cashback. F1 and F2 five-year fixed fee-assisted remortgage-only products have been reduced by up to 25bps and also start from 5.84%. They are available with a £1,295 fee and £500 cashback. The lender also launched a limited-edition Green EPC A-C product this month.

Priced at 5.39%, this five-year fixed product is available up to 75% LTV with a £4,495 fee and a minimum loan size of £200,000.

Kent Reliance reduced all its BTL fixed rates up to 20bps, including limited editions. Rates are available from 4.09% for a two-year fixed with a 5% product fee and from 4.49% for a five-year fixed with a 7% product fee. Both options are available up to 70% LTV.

The range features no maximum loan size, HMOs and MUFBs with up to 20 beds/units considered, along with limited company special purchase vehicle (SPV) and more complex structures.

Kensington Mortgages continued its summer specials with the introduction of a one-year fixed rate for BTL and residential borrowing to suit clients seeking greater flexibility through a shorter-term commitment.

The BTL (including limited company) products differ slightly, with one priced at 4.49% up to 75% LTV and the other at 4.94% up to 80% LTV. Both have a 2% fee. Self-employed clients can also benefit, with just one year's trading history required.

Family Building Society introduced two specials. The first is a five-year fixed rate priced at 4.89% for either purchase or remortgage. Available up to 60% LTV, it features £500 cashback for remortgage applications and a maximum loan size of £600,000.

For limited company applications, Family is offering a five-year fixed product priced at 4.99% with a 1% product fee, £500 cashback for remortgage applications and a minimum loan size of £600,000. Neither product is available for MUFBs.

Hampshire Trust Bank (HTB) has made changes this month to make it easier and more straightforward for clients to refinance their BTL properties. For pound-for-pound refinances, HTB will now apply the same serviceability criteria on a two-year fixed rate at pay rate without any loading.

Borrowers can expect uniform interest coverage ratio (ICR) calculations for both two- and five-year fixed terms, allowing for greater flexibility. Fees can also be added to the loan, ensuring the existing term lender is fully redeemed without additional upfront costs.

Finally, in an affordability update, Skipton has released useful information about how it approaches its stress testing.

It will work off market rent if backed up by valuation checks, using the higher of the declared rental figure and the valuation rental figure. This approach is more accommodating for landlords who are letting their property below market rent in order to hang on to a valuable long-standing tenant. It will also work off a higher current rental figure if it fits its stress test, even if the market rental figure has been down-valued.;

Caro Wilkinson, who taught Mr Swinney German when he was a pupil at Forrester High in Edinburgh, was among a group of campaigners from the Edinburgh Climate Coalition to stage a demonstration as the SNP conference got under way.

She recalled her former student as being "intelligent and caring", adding: "His kindness was clear when he organised a class whip-round when I was pregnant to buy me a teddy bear for my new baby."

However, she also insisted the First Minister was "clever enough to know how urgent the threat of climate change is", adding that she hoped he "cares enough for the planet to take the action that's needed".

Ms Wilkinson said: "If he does, he'll speak out against the huge Rosebank oil field, reject the proposed Peterhead gas-fired power station and do what he can to put the Scottish Government back on course to fight climate change."

The conference comes after the Scottish Government ditched its target to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030 - although ministers insist they are still committed to the overall goal of reaching net zero by 2045.

Commenting after the protest, Edinburgh Climate Coalition spokesman Luke Henderson said: "People around the world are already suffering from the impacts of changed climate in fires, floods and landslides, but the Scottish Government is going backwards and slowing down the action that will improve lives and cut climate pollution.

"Renewable energy is already far cheaper than new fossil fuels whilst solutions like making public transport more affordable and accessible will help more people get to where they need to be.";

With the festival shining a light on local and up-and-coming musicians, the event succeeded in bringing an "electric atmosphere" and a big boost to town centre venues.

This success is why organisers brought the festival back to the town centre in June, and have decided to relaunch it for a second time this summer.

            Title: Tyson Fury aftershave locked away at Home Bargains - it's only £14.99; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/home-bargains-locks-up-tyson-9519922; type: news; Description: Tyson Fury's affordable aftershave is under lock and key at Home Bargains to deter shoplifters, even though it's only worth £14.99. The heavyweight ring king's fragrance is on sale at the budget superstore - where he is known to enjoy shopping at.

It usually sells for £19.99, but the budget chain has the eau de toilette at a reduced price. The scent, called Fury by Tyson Fury, features the boxer and his old WBC belt on the front.

But the 100ml bottles have been placed in a locked glass cabinet at one of the branches. Customers have to ask an employee for help if they fancy a bottle.

A sign underneath reads: "Please ask a member of staff for assistance." One shopper was left baffled by it.

Dad-of-two, Dylan John told What's The Jam: "Security is not to be sniffed at here. I spotted Tyson's bottle on the shelf. I tried to open the cabinet to have a whiff, but it was locked.

"I had to ask a staff member to open the cabinet for me, so I could look at the boxer's fragrance. It was bonkers!"

Dylan, 46, also said: "There are other more expensive items in the store, but they are not under lock and key... The world has gone mad."

He spotted it at the Home Bargains on the Burnley Retail Park in his hometown, Lancashire. The former world champion, 36, famously visited his local Home Bargains store, in Morecambe, with his family.

It was after beating Deontay Wilder to win the WBC heavyweight title in 2020. The humble boxer went there despite being worth over £50million.

It comes as Oleksandr Usyk has made a bold prediction for Tyson Fury's fight against Anthony Joshua next year. Usyk, who has fought - and beaten - both Joshua and Fury, has now predicted how a tussle between the two might play out.

Usyk believes Joshua would come out on top. He told Boxing King Media: "I guess Anthony, 'AJ'. I guess 'AJ'."

The warning comes as St Albans City and District Council mulls over the introduction of an Access Pass parking benefit which is given to help older people, costing £190 a year.

Residents born before 1954 will be eligible for the parking pass. Councillor Helen Campbell said: "We are committed to being an inclusive Council that is responsive to the needs of all our community. We know that many of our older citizens are happy to pay by contactless cards and mobile phone apps, but there are some who struggle with these modern methods."

She explained that the pass is designed to help older drivers by providing a more traditional way of paying, making it easier for them to use car parks. "We want people to take part in this consultation and provide us with their views before we make any final decisions," she added.

One person shared: "It's merely an exercise so they can say the consulted people. Absolutely no one wants it, there's 100s of people complaining about it, but you can bet your bottom dollar the council will do it anyway."

"What would be good is clear instructions on an easy-to-use machine that takes both cards and cash, or novel idea, just put a parking attendant there who takes the money," a second said, as they reacted to the news from the local authority.

Someone else typed: "They've decided what they're going to do anyway so little point in a so-called 'consultation'. They won't listen, the decision has already been made. They're just trying to make it look like they're going through the motions."

Another person shared: "Why are people over 70 being charged almost £200 to park? What makes you think they can afford that given the recent cuts to TV licenses and heating allowance.

"I think you need to stop messing with parking and drop the plans to fleece us all to park in Harpenden town centre.";

            Title: حراك السويداء يتوجّه للتوسع في عامه الثاني; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%91%D9%87-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A; type: news; Description: جانب من حراك السويداء الشعبي، 30 أغسطس 2024 (العربي الجديد)

دعا المحتجون من ساحة الكرامة في مدينة السويداء جنوبي سورية، اليوم الجمعة، لتوسيع دائرة المشاركة في حراك السويداء لتشمل كافة أطياف المجتمع في المحافظة، بما في ذلك القاعدة الشعبية الممتدة بين الجمهور المراقب والحيادي، والآخر التابع للحزب الحاكم أو الزعامات العشائرية والدينية، محاولاً كسر الحواجز التي صنعها النظام بين محتجي الساحة والمجتمع المحلي، بهدف الوصول إلى رؤية وطنية جامعة.

وبيّن حراك السويداء الشعبي عبر مكوناته الكبرى، التي تتمثل بالهيئة العامة للحراك والتجمع المهني والهيئة الاجتماعية للعمل الوطني، توجهاً واضحاً لتجاوز حدود الخلافات والتناحر مع المكونات الاجتماعية الموالية للسلطة أو الرافضة الحراكَ الشعبي، من أجل الوصول إلى الحد الأدنى من المبادئ العامة التي تضمن حرية الرأي والتعبير للجميع، وتلزم الطرفين بحماية العمل السلمي كما كان، وعدم اللجوء إلى أي أشكال من القوة أو الاستناد إليها لمواجهة أي تعبير سلمي.

وفي هذا السياق، يقول الناشط المدني وليد الحناوي لـ"العربي الجديد" إنه "بعد عام من التناحر والاختلاف بين مكونات الحراك من جهة، والمكونات التي تسعى للحفاظ على الوضع الراهن، وبعد تجاوز العديد من العقبات التي وضعها النظام تباعاً خلال العام الفائت من عمر الحراك، نسعى اليوم، وبعد تثبيت ساحتنا ومبادئنا الوطنية في الحرية والعدالة الاجتماعية، إلى التوسع أفقياً وكسر الحواجز التي وضعها النظام الحاكم والمنتفعون منه، ونحاول أن نوصل رسالة إلى الجمهور المتفرج أننا نسعى لأجلنا جميعاً، ودونهم لن نحقق النتائج المرجوة. وفي نفس الوقت، نحاول أن نصل إلى قاعدة شعبية أوسع على مستوى المحافظة لننطلق من خلالها إلى المحيط السوري، فنحن ننشد التحرر من العبودية للجميع".

في هذا الوقت، تسعى السلطات، وعبر محافظ السويداء، للوصول إلى قاعدة شعبية من خلال الإسراع في توفير الخدمات الرئيسية وفي مقدمتها المياه، حيث لاحظ الأهالي سعي المحافظ الدؤوب لإصلاح العديد من آبار المياه، وإصلاح شبكات الكهرباء، وحتى الاتصالات المنقطعة عن بعض البلدات منذ أشهر.

وفي هذا الشأن، يقول حسام الصالح، أحد المشاركين في التظاهرة، لـ"العربي الجديد"؛ إن السويداء ونتيجة لحراكها الشعبي تتميز عن باقي المحافظات بمعظم الخدمات، وفي مقدمتها التيار الكهربائي الذي يصل إلى ساعتي تغذية مقابل ثلاث قطع، على خلاف باقي المحافظات التي لا ترى الكهرباء أكثر من ساعة كل خمس ساعات. أما المياه، ورغم الفساد الطويل الذي حلّ بالمؤسسة والموارد المالية خلال السنوات الماضية، ما زالت تحافظ على الحد الأدنى من حاجة المواطن، بل بدأت بتحسن ملحوظ، وكذلك الأمر في التعامل مع الحريات العامة للمواطنين، فلا شرطي أو دورية أمن تدخل منزلاً أو تعتقل مطلوباً سياسياً أو للخدمة العسكرية أو غيره".

وبالنتيجة؛ يقول الصالح إن "هناك تراكمات لممارسة الحرية في المحافظة ثبتها الحراك الشعبي وزاد عليها، ووقف حاجزاً في وجه التسلط والقمع السلطوي ودفع الجهات الحاكمة للمنافسة على القاعدة الشعبية في تقديم الخدمات وتسهيل التواصل والتعبير في طلب الحقوق حتى في ظل السلطة الممثلة بالمحافظ".

كما يرى الناشط الإعلامي ساري الحمد أن "هذا التحول الاستراتيجي في الحراك الشعبي يهدف إلى تعزيز موقعه على الساحة السورية، وزيادة الضغط على النظام لتلبية المطالب الشعبية، ويشكل تحدياً جديداً للنظام الذي يسعى لعزل الحراك وإضعافه". ويعتبر الحمد أن "توسيع قاعدة المشاركة في الحراك قد يساهم في تحقيق زخم أكبر للحركة الاحتجاجية، ويزيد الضغط على النظام لإجراء إصلاحات سياسية جوهرية". ولكنه يعتبر أيضاً أن هذا التوسع سيواجه تحديات كبيرة، كصعوبة توحيد الرؤى والمطالب بين مختلف الأطراف، وقد يلجأ النظام إلى أساليب قمع باردة جديدة لمواجهة هذا التوسع، وربما ستسعى القوى الإقليمية والدولية المستفيدة من وجود النظام السوري للتأثير على مسار حراك السويداء بهدف الحفاظ على مصالحها.

وختم الحمد حديثه لـ"العربي الجديد" بأنه يعتقد أن أي توسع للحراك الشعبي في السويداء سيكون بمثابة تحول مهم في مسار الأحداث في سورية، متسائلاً: "هل ستنجح الاستراتيجية الجديدة في تحقيق الهدف المنشود؟".;

            Title: Nick Cave labels Roger Waters "embarrassing" amid Israel boycott; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/nick-cave-labels-roger-waters-embarrassing-and-defends-playing-in-israel/; type: news; Description: Nick Cave has defended his decision to play in Israel, and spoken out against those that support a cultural boycott, including Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, who he labelled "embarrassing".

In 2017, Cave performed in the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, despite criticism from the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions movement. The organisation encourages artists to boycott playing Israel due to the ongoing conflict with Palestine, and Cave also received condemnation for his decision from Waters as well as Brian Eno, who are linked to the movement.

Taking to his Red Hand Files in 2018, Cave stated that he believed "the cultural boycott of Israel is cowardly and shameful". Six years later, the Australian musician's thoughts on the matter remain the same despite the escalation of the conflict in the last 12 months.

More than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in response to the October 7th terrorist attack by Hamas, which cost over 1,100 Israeli lives. Additionally, over two million people have been displaced from their homes with Gaza turned to rubble.

Now, in a new podcast interview with Reason, Cave has re-affirmed his position on the subject of cultural boycotts, stating, "I just feel - and I'm no friend of the government of Israel - but I just feel on some level that I find it difficult to come to terms with using my music in order to punish ordinary people because of the acts of their government. It sort of comes down to that, to some degree."

Cave then stated his view on cultural boycotts didn't only apply to Israel, adding, "I understand that this is a controversial thing to say, I just don't agree with a cultural boycott, in general."

Waters has been one of the most notable supporters of the cultural boycott of Israel along with Eno. When Cave chose to play Tel Aviv, Waters responded by saying, "Nick thinks this is about censorship of his music? What? Nick, with all due respect, your music is irrelevant to this issue, so is mine, so is Brian Eno's, so is Beethoven's, this isn't about music, it's about human rights."

In response, Cave has now said on the duo: "These are different people. Brian Eno is a different kettle of fish to Roger Waters, I think (he) is deeply damaging to the boycott movement. It's embarrassing. Brian Eno is a different character, he's a thoughtful individual."

Controversially, during a recent appearance on Piers Morgan Uncensored, the former Pink Floyd member denied the ruling by the United Nations that Hamas used sexual violence on October 7th. "No, they weren't," he maintained. "There was no evidence. You can say anything that you want, but there is no evidence."

On August 30th, 2024, Cave released his new album, Wild God, which he is set to tour later this year around Europe and the United Kingdom. At present, the Bad Seeds leader hasn't announced a visit to Israel as part of the run of dates.

In a three-and-a-half star review of the album, Far Out wrote: "All told, the record is largely a unique and powerful triumph. It boldly reaches for the heavens and often grabs the odd walloping fistful. However, to be entirely truthful, if in two years time the mood for a bit of Nick Cave hits his longstanding fans, the vast majority of people may well bypass Wild God in favour of Push the Sky Away, or have a good cry with Ghosteen instead.";

Leicester City Council has submitted plans for the return of the attraction ahead of the scaled back 2024 festivities.

The application comes a week after the council confirmed the usual two days of events for Diwali in the city will not be possible this year. The authority said its current threat of bankruptcy means it cannot currently afford the £250,000 annual price tag of the Hindu festival.

The cost-cutting means the light switch-on event will not be happening this year. Celebrations will instead be focused on just Diwali Day, with festivities set to take place on Thursday, October 31.

However, throughout the period of uncertainty around the make-up of Diwali in Leicester this year, city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby assured residents the lights which transform the Golden Mile each year will still be put up. Around 6,000 decorative lights illuminate the area each year.

Now, it seems they will be joined again by the Ferris wheel which has also become a familiar sight on the Golden Mile around Diwali. Plans suggest the wheel could be in place from Friday, October 4, to Monday, November 4.

It would be located in the Cranbourne Street Parking area, next to the Brahma Samaj Temple. Leicester City Council has set a target decision date for the application of Thursday, September 26.;
        
            Title: 'Unrealistic preconditions' could sink public-private partnerships in SA; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.dispatchlive.co.za/news/2024-08-30-unrealistic-preconditions-could-sink-public-private-partnerships-in-sa/; type: news; Description: The government risks sabotaging critical infrastructure projects with unrealistic preconditions for public-private partnerships, the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry cautioned on Friday.

President of the chamber Jacques Moolman said this was evident in Transnet's handling of the privatisation process for the container terminals at Ngqura and the container corridor between Johannesburg and Durban.

"Transnet is insisting potential partners take on all 3,573 Transnet Freight Rail staff as a precondition for involvement in the corridor project, it was reported this week. In addition, prospective partners would need to invest over R5bn in the project without acquiring any ownership stake," he said.

Moolman said it was unlikely the government would attract private partners unless the partnerships were based on sound business principles and policies.

"Government has committed to much-needed reform, especially in relation to key economic sectors such as energy and infrastructure. It needs to harness private-sector expertise to help the public service perform better. But the key reason the private sector outperforms the public sector is because private businesses demand their staff perform. If a business fails to perform, it loses customers and investors.

"The same principle must apply to Transnet and its critical infrastructure projects that are too important to fail. They require sound business principles to underpin operations.

"Transnet leaders cannot be allowed to prioritise their own wellbeing over what is best for the country.";

Global star Vanessa Williams has bid farewell to her 'Hoe summer' as she prepares to leave Plymouth for the West End after spending the last two months in the city. The former Miss America arrived in Plymouth back in June, ready to star in a preview run of the new stage musical adaptation of hit 2006 film, The Devil Wears Prada.

The new stage show recently finished previewing at Theatre Royal Plymouth, where it ran from July 6 to August 17, drawing audiences from all around the world. And Vanessa, 61, who is starring as lead character, Miranda Priestley, has now said goodbye to Plymouth with a tongue-in-cheek new video posted to her Instagram and TikTok accounts where it has gained over 67,000 likes, collectively, in less than 24 hours.

Strolling along Plymouth Hoe, dressed in an elegant blue sundress and stylish sunhat, the actress and singer said: "So I've heard back in the States, it's a Brat summer, but here in Plymouth, it's a Hoe summer."

She is then seen stopping at various points around the popular coastal area, and pointing at signs that include Hoe Street, Hoe Approach, and a tourist information board that reads: "Welcome to Plymouth Hoe."

Her reference to 'Brat summer' is, of course, referring to the new trend sweeping social media, whereby people are being inspired by the grungy aesthetic of singer Charlie XCX's new album, Brat.

And Vanessa's farewell video to Plymouth has delighted fans, who have flooded the comments sections, calling her "iconic" and "a queen".

One viewer commented: "Imagine just walking along Plymouth Hoe and bumping into this queen! I would die!" Another added: "As a Plymothian this is so iconic." And a third posted: "My forever icon in my home county."

Meanwhile, another fan wrote: "Thank you for coming down to our little city by the sea and sharing The Devil Wears Prada with us before it hits the London West End."

Vanessa has been posting photos and videos to her social media throughout the summer of her enjoying her time in Plymouth, soaking up the sunshine as she walked from the seaside to rehearsals.

She even got to enjoy Sting performing at Plymouth Summer Sessions back in June, sharing a video of herself hanging out the window of her accommodation as the concert went on, and saying: "I've come all the way down here, and guess who's right over there? It's my favourite, Sting! Amazing.";

The celeb-approved skincare brand has recently launched the latest strength in its "age defying" range that is beloved by beauty buffs. With the "highest strength retinal yet", the serum has been designed to dramatically reduce wrinkles.

Launched earlier this week, the Crystal Retinal 24 is stronger than any of its predecessors. Classed as "expert" level, it's best ideal for those who have incorporated retinol into their skincare routine and progressed through the entire Crystal Retinal stages.

Retailing at £109 for 30ml, Medik8's award-winning serum uses vitamin A to act "11 times faster" than regular retinol. Its clinically proven formula is said to reduce wrinkles, while leaving skin firmer and brighter within as little as seven days.

To celebrate the launch, the skincare firm has a "special gift" offer that gets customers a free 19ml Liquid Peptides Serum when they purchase the new Crystal Retinal 24. The travel-size bottle of this bestselling anti-wrinkle serum is worth £19, so we'd advise bagging it while you can.

A second praised: "I never thought I'd be able to use retinol because I have sensitive skin but Crystal Retinal is amazing. I'm up to strength 6 now! Skin feels smoother after one use and it's banished some milia I had on my forehead. Love it!"

Someone else remarked: "Having progressed through the various strength stages, the difference in fine lines and wrinkles is noticeable. Love love love this product, total staple in my skincare routine now!"

Caro Wilkinson, who taught Mr Swinney German when he was a pupil at Forrester High in Edinburgh, was among a group of campaigners from the Edinburgh Climate Coalition to stage a demonstration as the SNP conference got under way.

She recalled her former student as being "intelligent and caring", adding: "His kindness was clear when he organised a class whip-round when I was pregnant to buy me a teddy bear for my new baby."

However, she also insisted the First Minister was "clever enough to know how urgent the threat of climate change is", adding that she hoped he "cares enough for the planet to take the action that's needed".

Ms Wilkinson said: "If he does, he'll speak out against the huge Rosebank oil field, reject the proposed Peterhead gas-fired power station and do what he can to put the Scottish Government back on course to fight climate change."

The conference comes after the Scottish Government ditched its target to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030 - although ministers insist they are still committed to the overall goal of reaching net zero by 2045.

Commenting after the protest, Edinburgh Climate Coalition spokesman Luke Henderson said: "People around the world are already suffering from the impacts of changed climate in fires, floods and landslides, but the Scottish Government is going backwards and slowing down the action that will improve lives and cut climate pollution.

"Renewable energy is already far cheaper than new fossil fuels whilst solutions like making public transport more affordable and accessible will help more people get to where they need to be.";

- تم توقيف خمسة عناصر شرطة متورطين في الحادث، وأمر الرئيس الإيراني بتشكيل لجنة تحقيق لمعرفة ملابسات الوفاة، مع احتمال اتخاذ تدابير تأديبية.

- جاء التعامل السريع مع الحادث خشية من اندلاع احتجاجات مشابهة لتلك التي وقعت بعد وفاة مهسا أميني في 2022.

اعترفت الشرطة الإيرانية اليوم الجمعة، في بيان لها، بمقتل شاب في مقرّ لها شمالي البلاد، نتيجة تعرّضه للضرب على يد عناصر منها، وذلك بعد أوامر رئاسية بإجراء تحقيق في الحادثة. وأثار مقتل الشاب الإيراني مير محمد موسوي (36 عاماً) في مقرّ للشرطة بمدينة لاهيجان، ردود فعل غاضبة في أوساط المجتمع، ما دفع السلطات سريعاً إلى التعامل مع الحادث لاحتواء تداعياته المحتملة، وتوقيف خمسة عناصر شرطة مشتبهين بالتورط في تعذيب الضحية.

وقالت الشرطة الإيرانية في بيانها، إنّ "عناصر الشرطة لم يسيطروا على غضبهم ومشاعرهم بعدما قام الضحية بالإساءة إليهم وسبهم"، مشيرة إلى أنّ الطب العدلي يقوم بدراسة سبب الوفاة "بسبب الحوادث التي وقعت قبل تواجد الشرطة (في مكان النزاع) والظروف الجسدية والنفسية للراحل"، وذلك في إشارة إلى نزاع حصل بينه وبين شباب آخرين.

وأكدت الشرطة الإيرانية أنّ ما صدر من سلوك من بعض عناصر الشرطة "كان يتعارض مع النهج المهني للشرطة وغير مقبول بتاتاً"، مضيفة أنه تم وقف قائد مقر الشرطة وتوقيف بقية العناصر المتورطين في الحادث عن العمل، متحدثة عن احتمال اتخاذ تدابير تأديبية بشأن قيادات شرطية إن ثبت إهمالهم.

وبحسب وسائل إعلام إيرانية، فإنّ الشاب مير محمد موسوي اعتقل، يوم الخميس 22 أغسطس/ آب الجاري، في قضاء لاهيجان في محافظة جيلان شمالي إيران بعد تورطه في نزاع بالشارع مع شباب آخرين، ليتم نقله إلى المستشفى لاحقاً ميتاً.

وسرعان ما تداول رواد مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي في إيران مقطعاً مصوراً لجثة الشاب في المغسل، وقد ظهرت عليها آثار الكدمات والضرب. وأعلن المدعي العام في مدينة لاهيجان الإيرانية، إبراهيم أنصاري، توقيف خمسة عناصر شرطة متهمين بقتل الشاب موسوي، مضيفاً، وفق صحيفة "همشهري أونلاين" التابعة لبلدية طهران أنّ الجهاز القضائي بدأ تحقيقاته بشأن السبب الرئيس في القتل.

كما ذكر رئيس إعلام الحكومة الإيرانية، إلياس حضرتي، أنّ الرئيس الإيراني الإصلاحي مسعود بزشكيان، قد كلّف وزير الداخلية إسكندر مؤمني بضرورة تشكيل لجنة تحقيق لمعرفة ملابسات وفاة الشاب الإيراني في مقرّ الشرطة. كما أعلن المركز الإعلامي الشرطي الإيراني أنّ قائد قوات الأمن الداخلي (الشرطة) أحمد رضا رادان أيضاً أمر بتشكيل لجنة للغرض نفسه، وأوفد مفتشين إلى محافظة جيلان للتحقيق عن قرب بشأن الموضوع.

ووفق آراء ناشطين إيرانيين على مواقع التواصل، فإنّ التعامل السريع من السلطات مع ملف وفاة الشاب موسوي في مقر الشرطة، جاء على وقع خشية من اندلاع احتجاجات بسبب الحادث، مستذكرين ما حصل مع الشابة الراحلة مهسا أميني التي اعتقلت في سبتمبر/ أيلول 2022 من قبل شرطة الآداب في طهران، بتهمة عدم التقيّد بالحجاب، لكنها بعد سويعات من اعتقالها انتقلت إلى المستشفى في حالة مغمى عليها قبل أن تتوفى بعد يوم، وخلّفت وفاتها احتجاجات واسعة في البلاد وسط اتهامات طاولت الشرطة الإيرانية بضربها، غير أنها نفت ذلك. وتعرضت الشرطة والسلطات الإيرانية خلال السنوات الأخيرة لانتقادات من برلمانيين وناشطين بأنها لم تتخذ إجراءات سريعة لاحتواء حادث مهسا أميني منعاً لاندلاع احتجاجات.;
        
            Title: Spencer Matthews reveals huge six figure sum he's raised for charity; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/30166470/spencer-matthews-six-figure-sum-charity-marathons/; type: news; Description: Listen to Spencer talking to The Sun about his challenge in the video above

SPENCER Matthews has revealed the staggering amount he's raised for charity after completing a record-breaking endurance challenge.

The TV star ran 30 marathons in 30 days across the Jordanian desert in aid of Global's Make Some Noise, which supports small charities across the UK.

So far, the tally is a seriously impressive £512,000k and looks set to grow even further now he's back in the UK.

Appearing on Heart Breakfast today, he said: "That's insane. To be honest, the whole time that I was out there running, the charities were such a massive driver for me.

"And, as I said earlier, the support and the generosity shown throughout the challenge was completely overwhelming. And even just the messages on socials, I've never felt anything like that level of support for anything in my life.

"So, I can't thank you all enough. You know, I see this very much as - we only just finished this, I'm hoping for another few weeks of fundraising now. I'm going to think about ways to continue to raise money for these incredible causes and the great work that Global's Make Some Noise do.

"So, if you haven't yet donated, please consider donating, all your money makes such a big difference to incredible families and children who really deserve the help, so please consider it."

The desert challenge pushed Spencer to the limit and his body changed dramatically between the first marathon and the last - some 1,274km in total.

He spoke to us from the desert prior to breaking the record and revealed how he would spend his days after crossing the line.

"Life just needs to go back to normal for a bit, I think, before considering anything else," he said. "I've really missed pizza. I can't wait to have a pizza and a nice cold shower. A normal bed with some air conditioning would be nice."

He reunited with his adoring wife Vogue Williams and their two eldest children - Theo and Gigi - at the finish line.

The trio gave him a hero's welcome and lots of kisses and cuddles as he completed his goal close to the Dead Sea.

As unthinkably difficult as the gruelling feat of endurance was, it paled in comparison to the grim conditions he experienced between runs.

However, Spencer's smile was unwavering as he recalled eating flesh from a boiled goat's head, battling swarms of flies and sleeping on sweat-soaked mats.

He said: "The biggest low, I suppose, is that it's Groundhog Day. It's exactly the same every single day.

"The marathon has actually become my favourite part of the day because the rest of it is at the best of times pretty grim."

Each day a camp of sorts was erected close to the end of the planned route - though they were all far removed from the sites you may pitch up in around the British Isles.

He continued: "By camp, I mean a covering like a tent, no air conditioning, no toilets, no running water, rough grounds.

"We each have a mat. They are fluffy and furry. In 40 plus degrees [Celsius], they're not very comfortable.

"You lie on them with as few clothes on as possible because it's very, very hot. You sweat profusely into your mats on a daily basis."

Holding up the mat to camera, Spencer explained it's about two metres by 50 centimetres and not too dissimilar to a lilo.

"You eat on those. You relax on those. You sleep on those. You nap on those. That's where you spend the bulk of your day. About 18 hours a day you spend in camp. Obviously, you sleep in that time as well."

Sleep was difficult to come by at times, with Spencer getting as little as two hours of shut-eye some nights before having to get up and run another marathon.

Though he found little sympathy, telling me: "No one gives a sh*t if you sleep for two hours."

The sheer scale of the desert and its remoteness surprised him, with up to 100km between towns and villages, while the local cuisine was of an acquired taste meaning he went hungry for long periods of time.

"It's not like there is nothing in these towns," he said. "We've come across the odd chicken shop that's all right, but there's nothing. There's no supermarkets.

"It's quite a difficult place to exist unless you're from here. It's certainly very new to us. We were served a goat's head for dinner, which of course is an interesting dish, but it was a goat's head that was boiled and then put on a tray with some rice around it.

"That's it. You're just picking its face off its skull and eating it. I'm starving a lot of the time.

"I don't want to make it sound like a terrible experience because it's been one of the best experiences of my life. Camp is something I hadn't really accounted for. It is not nice."

The camp conditions were so bad that Spencer banned Vogue and their kids from joining him days ahead of the finish.

"This is no place for kids," he said.

"Vogue would last less than five minutes in one of these camps. That's no poor reflection on her. It's deeply unpleasant.

"Contrast that with the earlier camps in Wadi Rum Desert. Insane, amazing, no flies, beautiful, canyons, sunsets, sunrises, insane stars, shooting stars. All that's been gone for a little while now."

It was the relentless harassment from flies that proved particularly troublesome deep into the challenge.

"There's a real fly issue in some camps if you're near a plantation," he said. "I don't know what they do, by the way, like grow or whatever, but they call them plantations.

"I mean you're racing around outside, eating your food. If you sat still, there'd be all of your food all over you.

"You can't nap because you're just repeatedly slapping yourself in the face to get rid of them. It doesn't sound like it would be a big issue, but I actually can't tell you the level of frustration that comes with these flies.

"They disappear at 6.30pm on the dot. It's like they're late for something. They literally just vanish."

The military precision of the whole operation, which was eight months in the making, is what Spencer credits with helping to keep that smile on his face, as well as the knowledge that his efforts were raising a huge sum of money for Global's Make Some Noise charity, which helps people all over the UK.

He was also joined by a stellar team without which the challenge would not have come to fruition. Those men are running coach Chris Taylor, physio Jonny Heath, Dr. Joshua Alisson, and videographer Matt Stone.

Then there was guest runner, celebrity chef and founder of British butter company All Things Butter, Thomas Straker, who decided to join Spencer for the 22nd leg of his Great Desert Challenge after an encounter at his West London restaurant earlier in the year.

The slick plan was also responsible for Spencer receiving messages from some awestruck followers who claimed he was making it look easy.

"I personally don't think that these challenges have to revolve around pain and misery and jeopardy," said Spencer. "Jeopardy is the antithesis of good preparation.

"If you're well prepared for something, in an ideal world, there won't be any jeopardy. I'm getting a few messages saying, you're making this look really easy. It's good.

"That means I'm doing a really good job. When I get a message like that, it just makes me think the team are professional, the plan is working.

"Every day is the same, but we are grinding through a plan that we created earlier this year. This challenge for me started in January. This isn't a 30-day thing.

"I've been getting as prepared as I humanly can be to succeed. I don't want to come out here and fail. So I've done everything I can to make sure that I don't."

Among the supportive messages he received was one from 'The Hardest Geezer', Russ Cook, who earlier this year became the first person to run the entire length of Africa.

It meant a lot as Spencer had followed Russ's Africa run with interest and was impressed by his mental fortitude.

"I think I engaged with Russ's efforts more because of his energy," said Spencer. "Obviously, his athletic achievement was crazy as well, but the thing that I was more taken by with him was his enthusiasm for life.

"His general nature made me very interested in him as a person, instead of what he could have been doing. I'm sure he had tons of issues along the way, but he chose to focus on energetic, positive messaging.

"Which is exactly how I would want to be in this situation, and I think how I have been."

The driven family man Spencer is today is unrecognisable from his 20-something self.

Back then he was a party-loving Made In Chelsea star who had an alcohol problem so severe that he could have died had he not taken drastic action.

These days he runs the successful non-alcoholic beverage brand Clean Co. and very rarely drinks.

"Running's really changed my life," he said. "I've come a really, really long way from where I was a few years ago. I'm really proud of myself, which is a beautiful feeling to have.

"I've lived for many years in shame of my own behaviour and my own actions. So, to feel like I've come out of that and, touch wood, all being well, have managed to achieve this completely unprecedented, wild task will be a new chapter in my life.

"I really don't know what will come of it, but there will be more of it, I think, because I think I'm pretty good at it. It's a nice thing to feel sometimes."

Though he's no stranger to endurance events having already completed the Marathon des Sables and a Jungle Ultra Marathon, Spencer believes this record-breaking feat could spur him on to even greater achievements.

He said: "I've really loved this, the adventurous side of it and the pushing yourself to extreme limits. I hope it inspires some other people to start running or increase their velocity of running or their distance or their mileage and push themselves to do that thing that they might feel is impossible. Because I can tell you that from where I was to where I am now, I believe that anything is possible at this stage.

"I find it really annoying when people say, anything is possible, but I can't tell you where I was five or six years ago compared to now. So, I do feel like with a bit of dedication, hard work and action, you can really make positive change in your life. I hope this inspires somebody to go out there and do something cool."

There's no doubt he has achieved that goal and then some.

Complaints have come from the Huntington and Great Boughton parts of Chester with residents stating that water 'has been tinged brown and tastes weird', Cheshire Live reports. Utility firm Severn Trent has said it is 'flushing the local network' after the concerns were raised.

The complaints have come as work began in January on Severn Trent's £16 million Chester Resilience project - a plan to install a 3km water pipe in Chester. The project will see Huntington and Boughton water treatment works linked.

The firm has said the water remains safe to drink with 'no risk to peoples' health'. Sources knowledgeable on the incident said the change in taste and smell of tap water in the area is due to a release of a substance that is used in food preparation into a tributary of the River Dee.

It is understood the substance poses no health risks at the concentrations seen. CheshireLive understands investigations into the source are ongoing, and that the incident has been reported to the UK Health Security Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate.

Local residents took to social media to complain about the water, with one saying the tap water is 'often been tinged brown and tasting weird'. Another reported a 'strange taste and smell' while yet another resident bemoaned the 'disgusting quality of the water'.

One person said the water had been 'undrinkable for months'. A Severn Trent spokesperson said: "We are aware that a small number of customers are currently experiencing a different taste or smell to their water than normal.

"This is nothing to worry about, there is no risk to peoples' health and water remains safe to drink. We have teams flushing the local network and we are seeing improvements.

"We apologise for any inconvenience and would like to reassure everyone that our teams are working hard to get everything back to normal as quickly as possible."

            Title: كومباني يدافع عن كيميتش.. هل يصبح قائد منتخب ألمانيا؟; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.alaraby.co.uk/sport/%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B4-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%AD-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A8-%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7; type: news; Description: - دعم مدرب بايرن ميونخ فينسنت كومباني لاعبه جوشوا كيميتش كقائد محتمل للمنتخب الألماني بعد اعتزال العديد من النجوم مثل توني كروس ومانويل نوير وإلكاي غوندوغان.

- ماريو باسلر، لاعب منتخب ألمانيا السابق، يعارض تعيين كيميتش كقائد ويفضل جمال موسيالا، مشيراً إلى أن موسيالا يجب أن يحمل شارة القيادة لمدة طويلة.

- المنتخب الألماني يمر بمرحلة انتقالية بعد الفشل في يورو 2024، ويسعى للتجديد والعودة إلى منصات التتويج بعد آخر نجاح كبير في كأس العالم 2014.

وقف مدرب بايرن ميونخ البلجيكي فينسنت كومباني إلى جانب لاعبه جوشوا كيميتش المرشح لحمل شارة قيادة المنتخب الألماني بعد اعتزال العديد من الأسماء خلال الفترة الماضية، على غرار إسدال توني كروس الستار على مسيرته بشكل نهائي، في حين علق مانويل نوير قفازه دولياً، وقرر إلكاي غوندوغان وضع حد لرحلته مع الماكينات، ليتفرغ للعب مع ناديه الحالي مانشستر سيتي.

وكان لاعب منتخب ألمانيا وبايرن ميونخ السابق ماريو باسلر أكد، قبل أيام، في تصريحات نقلتها صحيفة بيلد الألمانية، أنه لا يرغب في رؤية كيميتش قائداً للمنتخب: "جمال موسيالا يجب أن يحمل شارة القيادة مدة عشرة أعوام أو 12 عاماً (..) سيبقى في المنتخب سنوات عديدة، لست مقتنعاً بكيميتش قائداً، لن أرحب به، لا يمكنك ارتكاب خطأ بإعطاء مزيد من المسؤوليات لهؤلاء اللاعبين".

وقال كومباني بعد هذه الانتقادات في مؤتمر صحافي اليوم الجمعة قبيل مواجهة فرايبورغ في الدوري الألماني: "كيميتش قائد لا غبار عليه، ما أظهره جوشوا حتى الآن مهم للغاية لأنّه قدّم ما يحتاجه".

ويعيش منتخب ألمانيا مرحلة انتقاليه مع رحيل العديد من نجومه، ومحاولة التجديد من أجل العودة إلى منصات التتويج، خاصة بعد الفشل في يورو 2024 الأخيرة التي استضافتها البلاد، في حين أن آخر تتويج كبير كان في كأس العالم 2014 في البرازيل وقبلها بطولة أمم أوروبا 1996.;
        
            Title: Thousands of people 'only receiving fraction of full state pension'; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.eveshamjournal.co.uk/news/24551971.dwp-pension-warning-thousands-only-receiving-fraction/; type: news; Description: Pensioners have been warned that only half of them are getting the full weekly amount of the new state pension.

New analysis has shown that around 150,000 pensioners were on less than £100 a week.

Royal London said that 1,737,342 of 3,407,567 people receiving the new pension received the full weekly amount last year.

It made the calculations using Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) data from spring 2023.

The full state pension for 2024/25 is £221.20 a week, up from £203.85 last year.

In general, to get the pension people need to have 35 years of national insurance contributions (NICs). Those with fewer "qualifying" years receive a proportionately smaller state pension.

Royal London found that 149,317 pensioners who had reached state pension age from April 2016 were receiving a state pension of less than £100 a week - and 17,546 pensioners were receiving less than £20 a week.

It also said that 5,677 people were receiving less than £10 a week.

The new state pension system was introduced in 2016 to provide a sustainable, clear foundation pension for people to build their private savings on.

Many people will have other sources of income alongside the state pension, such as workplace or private pensions.

Pensioners on low incomes may be entitled to claim pension credit, which can top up their incomes and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) recently launched an awareness drive to boost take-up.

While around 1.4 million pensioners are already receiving pension credit, there are up to an estimated 880,000 households eligible for the support who are yet to claim.

Around 10 million pensioners are set to lose out on winter fuel payments as the new Government restricts the benefit to only those receiving pension credit.

The move was announced by the Government as part of a package of measures designed to tackle a £22 billion "black hole".

Sarah Pennells, consumer finance specialist at Royal London, said: "We often talk about the full state pension amount, but these figures show how many pensioners are getting only a fraction of that.

"One of the main reasons why people miss out on the full state pension is because they have gaps in their national insurance record, but they may not realise this until it's too late to do anything about it.

"You may have national insurance gaps because, for example, you were working but had low earnings, were unemployed but didn't claim benefits, were a high earner with young children who didn't register for child benefit, or because you were working abroad.

"The good news is that, even if you have gaps in your national insurance record going back over a decade or more, it may still be possible to top up your national insurance contributions and increase the amount of state pension you're entitled to.

"Under the new state pension system, you don't get any state pension at all if you have fewer than 10 years' national insurance, so it's important to check your national insurance contribution record."

A DWP spokesperson said: "Ensuring a better deal for the pensioners of today and tomorrow is a priority for this Government.

"There are a variety of reasons why some pensioners have a lower state pension - including contracting-out and paying less national insurance contributions - which is why we encourage those on the lowest incomes to claim for pension credit, worth on average £3,900 per year.

"Through our commitment to protect the triple lock over 12 million pensioners will benefit, with many expected to see their state pension increase by around a thousand pounds over the next five years.";

On Saturday, August 24, Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service received a call at 4.30am to reports of the fire.

BCP Council has said it is waiting for a specialist fire damage structural survey to come through, advising if any work will need to be done.

Richard Herrett, BCP Council's cabinet member for commercial operations, said: "Due to the vehicle fires that took place in the Quay visitors car park last weekend, we must keep the car park closed at this time, pending a specialist fire damage structural survey and any remedial work that needs to take place.

"We ask that Quay visitors use one of the many alternative surface and multi storey car parks, and we will update as soon as we have further information."

Following enquiries, Dorset Police arrested a 32-year-old man from Poole on suspicion of arson but was released on police bail as officers continue their investigation.

A spokesperson for DWFRS said: "[The vehicles] were 100 per cent damaged by fire and unfortunately, there was one vehicle on the first floor and one on the second floor of the car park."

Three fire crews from Poole attended the incident and extinguished the fire using two hose reel jets and two breathing apparatus.

Hydraulic-cutting equipment was used to access the vehicles so police could identify them.;

Some 88,350 people were in prison as of August 30, Ministry of Justice figures show.

This is up 116 from 88,234 a week ago and an increase of 988 from 87,362 four weeks ago on August 2.

It is the highest end-of-week figure since weekly population data was first published in 2011, according to analysis by the PA news agency.

It also surpasses the highest total ever recorded, which was 88,336 at end the February 2024, based on separate figures for the end-of-month population size.

The sharp rise in recent weeks is likely to have been driven by the number of jail sentences handed to people found guilty of taking part in the recent disorder across parts of the country.

The prison population in England and Wales has been rising for much of the past three years, having dropped as low as 77,727 in April 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Before the pandemic, the figure had been above 80,000 since December 2006.

In the aftermath of the summer 2011 riots, the number climbed as high as 88,179 on December 2 2011, before falling back in subsequent months.;

They sell a large range of toys, action figures, comics, graphic novels and board/card games.

But this week, the family-run shop - based on Parnie Street in the city's Trongate - confirmed it is to shut permanently.

Staff revealed on social media they are holding a closing-down sale, with 25 per cent off all stock in store.

The post read: "A1 Toys Parnie Street is closing down. Our closing down sale starts today with 25 per cent off the ticket price on all stock.

"Closing down offer only applicable in-store. Opening hours may change but full details will follow regarding this."

The firm's second shop Static Games - on nearby King Street - will remain open.

Static Games sells a large selection of board games, collectable and trading card games.

One wrote: "Sad to see this place close down. Got most of my power rangers legacy collection from these guys around 2016-2018."

Another commented: "I definitely will miss the shop as it has definitely helped me buy and sell over the last few years.

"You guys have been amazing and I honestly feel sad to hear of this situation.

"All the best in your future endeavours and I'll try to find a way to come in soon."

A third said: "Man I'm sorry to hear this, you guys are my go to shop for everything I need.

A fourth added: "Sorry to hear this. I remember the days when David & Kenny had their stall in the Argyle Market and organised Comic Marts!

"When the Parnie Street store opened, there were lots of comic & book signings, sometimes with guests from Albacon events. A1 was a Glasgow institution and will be missed."

It comes as a major retailer with 140 stores is set to close a branch in a busy Scottish town, leaving shoppers gutted.

            Title: The Count of Monte Cristo (2024) Review - HeyUGuys; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.heyuguys.com/the-count-of-monte-cristo-2024-review/; type: news; Description: The Count of Monte Cristo, directed by Matthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de La Patellière, made its world premiere at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it received a resounding 11-minute standing ovation.

Produced by Pathé Films, the same company behind the acclaimed The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023), this film continues the studio's tradition of bringing classic French literature to life with grandiosity and meticulous attention to detail. In France, the film has been both a box office success and a cultural event, celebrated for its faithful adaptation of a beloved classic.

The film follows the tragic tale of Edmond Dantès (played by Pierre Niney), a young and promising sailor who is falsely accused of treason and imprisoned in the dreaded Château d'If. After years of enduring unimaginable hardship, he escapes and reinvents himself as the mysterious and wealthy Count of Monte Cristo, bent on exacting revenge against those who betrayed him. His intricate plans for vengeance target his former friend Fernand de Morcerf (Bastien Bouillon), the corrupt prosecutor Gérard de Villefort (Laurent Lafitte), and the envious Danglars (Patrick Mille), each of whom played a role in his downfall. Along the way, the film also explores Dantès' deep-seated love for Mercedes (Anaïs Demoustier),who has moved on with her life, unaware of his true fate.

Visually, The Count of Monte Cristo is nothing short of breath-taking. The cinematography by Nicolas Bolduc is particularly impressive, capturing the stark contrast between the dark, oppressive confines of Château d'If and the opulent, sun-drenched estates of the wealthy elite. Fontaine's use of light and shadow underscores the film's themes of secrecy, deception, and vengeance.

Delaporte and de La Patellière's direction is precise, guiding the film through its complex plot with a steady hand. They expertly balance the film's thrilling action sequences with its more introspective moments, delving into the destructive power of revenge and obsession. These themes are explored in depth, showing how Dantès' single-minded pursuit of vengeance ultimately consumes him, threatening to destroy not only his enemies but also himself.

The performances in the film are exceptional, with Niney delivering a powerful portrayal of Edmond Dantès. He captures the character's transformation from a naive young man to a hardened and vengeful individual with incredible nuance. The film remains remarkably close to Alexandre Dumas' original text, capturing the spirit and complexity of the novel while also making the story accessible to contemporary audiences.

Overall, The Count of Monte Cristo is a masterful adaptation that stands as one of the best renditions of Dumas' work to date. The screenplay, penned by the co-directors Matthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de La Patellière, is tightly woven, ensuring that every twist and turn of the plot is delivered with maximum impact. The film's takeaway is a haunting reflection on the cost of revenge and the perils of letting obsession dictate one's life. This adaptation not only honours the original novel but also enhances it, offering a fresh and compelling take on a timeless tale.;

The charts, from netweather.tv, are supported by the latest forecasts from the Met Office.

They show a high chance of high pressure building up in southern Europe and pushing northwards - bringing temperatures as high as 26C to the south east next weekend.

These so-called Iberian or Spanish plumes have been responsible for a number of mini-heatwaves in the UK this summer. And they brought the the heat again this week, after the wind and rain of Storm Lillian.

The maps show Britain could be in for the hot weather blast from Friday, September 6 with balmy 24C highs.

Moving onto Saturday, September 7, things will heat up even further with highs of 26C in London and the south east.;

The complete set, including stores in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, will employ 1,000 people and Homebase workers at risk of redundancy will be guaranteed an interview.

Damian McGloughlin, the managing director of Homebase, wrote to suppliers on Thursday (August 29) to say it was trading "behind where we planned to be" and would begin an "active sale process" to seek new investment next week, The Guardian reports.

The locations of the Homebase stores Sainsbury's will be buying are:

The converted shops will add a total of around 235,000 square feet to Sainsbury's' supermarket trading space.

It added that the first of these shops is expected to open as a supermarket next summer, with plans to complete all the conversions by the end of 2025.

Simon Roberts, chief executive of the supermarket group, said: "Sainsbury's food business continues to go from strength to strength as we push ahead with our Next Level Sainsbury's plan.

"We have the best combination of value and quality in the market and that's winning us customers from all our key competitors and driving consistent growth in volume market share.

"We want to build on this momentum which is why we are growing our supermarket footprint.

"Our ambition is to be customers' first choice for food and these new stores will showcase some of the best that Sainsbury's supermarkets have to offer to even more communities around the country."

The expansion comes five years after Sainsbury's closed 15 large supermarkets and dozens of Argos stores after discounters Aldi and Lidl stepped up expansion in the UK, putting pressure on traditional chains.

The Guardian reports that Homebase's current owners Hilco tried to sell the brand four years ago and reportedly put it back on the market this spring.

The DIY chain was created by Sainsbury's in 1979 and sold off by the supermarket in 2006.

After the sale of the 10 stores, it will shrink to just over 130 outlets, almost half the 250 it had when Hilco bought it for £1 from the Australian retail group Wesfarmers in 2018.;
        
            Title: BlackByte ransomware returns with new tactics, targets VMware ESXi; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/blackbyte-ransomware-returns-with-new-tactics-targets-vmware-esxi; type: news; Description: BlackByte also stops exclusively using commercial remote desktop tools

The ransomware operators known as BlackByte appaear to have shifted tactics, pivoting away from targeting vulnerable devices and focusing instead on flawed VMware ESXi hypervisors.

The group has also started using remote desktop software sanctioned by the victim organization, instead of deploying commercial software themselves, new research from Cisco Talos has claimed.

In a blog post, Talos IR researchers said while BlackByte "continues to leverage tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPS) that have formed the foundation of its tradecraft since its inception," it was also recently seen using techniques that "depart" from that. Namely, taking advantage of CVE-2024-37085, an authentication bypass vulnerability found in VMware ESXi.

Talos IR also argues that BlackByte is significantly more active than its data leak site would imply. In fact, the researchers believe only 20-30% of successful attacks end up on the data leak site. They don't know for certain why BlackByte publishes only a handful of its activities, but we can speculate that many victims end up paying the ransom, if that means keeping the breach private.

BlackByte was first spotted in mid-2021, with researchers believing the group spun out off the defunct Conti ransomware group. For those unaware, Conti was a major ransomware player in the months leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the war, Conti publicly expressed its support for the Russian war machine, drawing fury from its affiliates, many of whom were Ukrainian.

Soon after, Conti's source code, as well as thousands of private messages, were leaked by disgruntled affiliates, which ultimately led to the group's disbandment. Since the source code leaked, different other groups stepped in, with BlackByte likely being one of them.

This group is known for using vulnerable drivers to bypass security controls, and for deploying self-propagating ransomware with worm-like capabilities. It was also observed using known-good system binaries (LoLBins), and other legitimate commercial tools.;

L'Equipe report that the 26-year-old is not certain to stay in France, with City opening talks for him. He scored eight goals in Ligue 1 last season, having netted 19 times in 80 appearances in all competitions for Nantes across the past two seasons.

Like other strikers City have been linked to in recent weeks, Mohamed has a strong build and looks adept at holding up the ball with his back to goal, while also offering an aerial threat in the box. He's got good defensive stats for a striker too.

But, he has not been the most prolific goal-scoring threat since joining Nantes. Perhaps that's why he's only been used as a substitute in their first two Ligue 1 matches of this campaign.

It seems Nantes are happy to sell. L'Equipe reported earlier this week that a Saudi Arabian club had had a €15m (£12.5m) offer accepted, only for Mohamed to turn down the move, the striker not keen on a switch to the Middle East. Since then, Wolves and Marseille have both been named as suitors.

If City are to do an incoming deal before the transfer window's 11pm cut-off on Friday night, it will be for a forward, with the club ideally wanting to give Steve Cooper an alternative option alongside Jamie Vardy, Patson Daka, and Jordan Ayew. Previous deals have fallen through or proven too expensive, leaving City without a stand-out target going into the final few hours of the window.

She expressed: "It's just not nice and I feel everything has been blown way out of proportion and it has all got a bit carried away with itself and I think the last thing I want to do is fuel that fire and stir that pot when it doesn't need to be stirred."

She also extended heartfelt gratitude to her followers, saying, "from the bottom of my heart" for their unwavering support in the fortnight following her announcement of the split on August 14.

In her vlog, Molly-Mae didn't shy away from mentioning Tommy, acknowledging him as "He is Bambi's dad and I will always value him and respect him and obviously always have a lot of love for him. We were together for five years and it is very, very sad."

The vlog continued with snippets of Molly-Mae's life recently, including a trip to a drive-thru where she almost scorched her tongue on a baked beans and cheese toastie, and a pampering session at Champneys spa that ended with a touching gesture of a soft toy for Bambi.

Holding back tears, she remarked, "Let's not cry now," upon receiving the thoughtful present. The vlog also featured an adorable moment with daughter Bambi, as Molly-Mae read her a story.

            Title: Cop's warning over 'suspicious' meat that could spark 'serious health issues'; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/30164873/suspicious-meat-burglary-sheep-worcestershire/; type: news; Description: COPS have issued an urgent warning over "suspicious" meat after experts warned it could cause "serious health issues".

Three medicated sheep were burgled from the village of Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, over the Bank Holiday weekend, say West Mercia Police.

Shoppers are urged to stick to reputably sourced meat, as the sheep in question are unfit for human consumption due to the medication they were on.

Although the incident took place in Worcestershire, police also extended the warning to residents across Herefordshire and Shropshire.

PCSO Kate Easthope said: "We're concerned that if the meat from these sheep has entered the food chain it could cause serious health issues for those who consume it.

"As always, for your safety we would only advise buying and consuming meat from reputable sources.

"As well as being unsafe for consumers, illegal butchery is a serious offence which can cause unnecessary suffering to the animal. Rural crimes like this also have serious emotional and financial impact on our farming communities.

"We've launched an investigation into this incident and I would ask, as always, that people contact us if they think someone is selling illegal meat."

The news comes after a similar incident earlier this year, in which two Reading businesses were found in possession of 400kg of illegal meat products.

The meat, which included sheep heads, cutlets, leg joints and offal - some of which was more than a year old - was found to be in breach of food hygiene standards.

Two weeks ago, the National Sheep Association (NSA) also warned of an "alarming rise" in illegal sheep meat imports - with sheep being transported from abroad without adequate checks.

NSA chief executive Phil Stocker said this could introduce new diseases to the UK food system, and urged the Labour government to roll out "swift and effective measures."

Anyone with information about the theft of the sheep, or who may have been offered meat for sale in the last few days which may be suspicious, is asked to contact PSCO Kate Easthope on 07773046202 or kate.easthope@westmercia.police.uk quoting incident number 453i of 25 August.;
        
            Title: Young Saints defender set for move to Brentford worth up to £10million; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/24551993.southampton-defender-set-10million-move-brentford/; type: news; Description: YOUNG Saints defender Jayden Meghoma is set for a medical at Brentford ahead of a move worth up to £10million, the Daily Echo understands.

Meghoma, 18, made four senior appearances for Saints under manager Russell Martin since joining from Tottenham Hotspur in 2022.

However, the youngster's Southampton contract was due to expire at the end of this season with Meghoma having no intention of signing an extension.

Brentford are set to seal the signing of the England under-19 youth international, with an initial £5million payment and a further £5million in add-ons.

The Bees look to complete a move before this evening's 11pm transfer deadline, while Saints hope to raise funds for more additions.

Meghoma was not involved in Southampton's senior pre-season despite his regular involvement in the squad last campaign.

Had he signed a new deal with the club and committed his future, it is likely he would have seen the pitch during the club's tour in Spain.;

            Title: Dunelm's 'luxurious' new £32 autumn bedding set that 'doesn't need ironing'; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/dunelms-luxurious-new-32-autumn-33562526; type: news; Description: As we approach the colder autumn season, now is probably a good time to begin thinking about giving your bedroom décor an overhaul.

Let's face it, there's nothing better than some new bedding that doesn't just reflect the new weather, but is also easy to care for. For these reasons, shoppers are racing to Dunelm for an "expensive" looking new set.

The Mandalay Duvet Cover and Pillowcase Set, which has a near perfect rating, is a new addition to the retailer's "Autumn Bedding" section. It's available as a single to a super kingsize, with prices ranging between £32 - £52, depending on your bed size.

Crafted with finer details and a pinsonic textured design, this bedding set has been praised for its "luxury look and feel". The soft, comfortable polyester material has been praised for its "non crease" quality, meaning it "requires no ironing."

The Mandalay Duvet Cover and Pillowcase Set comes in six colours to match any modern home interior - pink clay, pacific blue, yellow, mushroom, olive and white. It can also be easily be popped in the washing machine for a quick freshen up.

Currently rated 4.8 stars based on 1,418 reviews on the Dunelm website, shoppers have raved over the autumn bedding set's "great quality" that makes it look "more expensive than it is".

A thrilled customer praised: "Great quality, very good price and no need to iron! I couldn't be more pleased, it looks expensive and matches my room perfectly!"

A second happy customer said: "This set is beautiful. I have always thought I would buy my bedding at a well known high street store - but thought I would try Dunelm and I was so pleased with the set. It is high quality, luxurious and does not need ironing - I then ordered a second set!"

Another shopper gushed: "Fantastic quality. Simplistic with a luxury look and feel. Best bit is, it doesn't need ironing. Happy days."

While another penned: "So lovely and soft. Washes well. Love the quilted top which looks luxurious and more expensive than it is!"

A drawback some shoppers have found is the inconsistent sizing, as one wrote: "Love the design and quality but the sizing is totally off. I have a king-size bed and duvet so bought the king-size bedding and it is way too big for my duvet and hangs over the sides of the bed."

Update your autumn bedroom with Dunelm's new Mandalay Duvet Cover and Pillowcase Set that can be bought here.

With the colder nights creeping in, many retailers are beginning to offer warmer bedding. For example, Argos is stocking the Habitat Cotton Contrast Waffle Beige Bedding Set from £26.25 to £50, depending on your bed size.

Over at Wayfair, the Luxury Jumbo Cord Faux Fur Duvet Set has been crafted using a thicker style knit that will keep you nice and toasty during the chillier nights. It is priced between £40.99 and £64.99.

            Title: Barry Keoghan's Peaky Blinders casting has led to a shared false memory among fans - Liverpool Echo; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/barry-keoghans-peaky-blinders-casting-29837978; type: news; Description: The Irish actor will be joining Cillian Murphy in the upcoming Peaky Blinders movie

Peaky Blinders fans are convinced that newcomer Barry Keoghan has previously appeared in the TV show.

The Saltburn and Masters of the Air actor officially joined the cast of Netflix's Peaky Blinders film this week, where he'll be sharing screen space with fellow Irishman Cillian Murphy and Silo star Rebecca Ferguson.

On Reddit, it seems as though Keoghan's involvement has sparked a sort of Mandela Effect. This phenomenon is defined by a collective false memory, with past notable examples including the belief that board game character Mr Monopoly sports a monocle (he doesn't) and that Mickey Mouse wears suspenders, reports the Mirror.

Now, it appears the phenomenon has struck again, this time among Peaky Blinders fans who believe Keoghan has featured in the series before. "Honestly, if you told me that Barry Keoghan was in the Peaky Blinders series I'd believe you and my brain would produce false memories of watching him in it," one fan wrote.

Another commented: "I literally just came back from IMDB to check who he played in the show again," while another viewer was surprised that the film will mark his first venture into the Peaky Blinders world. "Wtf I genuinely thought he was already in the show," they expressed.

Confusion reigned on social media as fans exchanged messages about Barry Keoghan's latest role, with some stating: "I feel like I've already seen him in it?" and questioning "I thought he was in the show already before, no?". Another observer took a moment to realise, sharing: "It took me like five minutes to realise oh actually he's not in the original TV series? Like he looks like he's a Peaky Blinder star lol."

The announcement of Keoghan's addition to the cast has spurred joy among admirers of the Oscar-nominated actor, with praises such as "He was great in Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Banshees of Inisherin" and an excited claim that "Barry Keoghan in Peaky Blinders? This movie just went from hype to legendary," from enthralled fans.

Another commentator noted the shared Bat-verse lineage between Keoghan and Murphy, with past portrayals of iconic figures The Joker (in The Batman) and Scarecrow (in Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises).

Cillian Murphy has voiced his own excitement about the upcoming Peaky Blinders film, expressing in a statement: "It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me. It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.";

            Title: Exciting new addition planned for popular wildlife centre; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.tivysideadvertiser.co.uk/news/24551696.exciting-new-addition-planned-welsh-wildlife-centre/; type: news; Description: Plans for a new play area at the Welsh Wildlife Centre near Cardigan have been submitted to Pembrokeshire County Council.

The Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales seeks permission for a children's Play Area comprising timber play equipment and associated ground works at the Welsh Wildlife Centre, Cilgerran.

The Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales (WTSWW) is the fourth largest Wildlife Trust in the UK, managing 110 nature reserves, including Skomer and Skokholm island.

The Welsh Wildlife Centre, within the Teifi Marshes Nature Reserve, provides a range of facilities including a visitor centre with shop and display rooms, café and WTSWW offices, together with a visitor car park, play area, walking trails, bird hides and a cottage for self-catering guests.

The site of the proposed play area is located on an informal grassland meadow recreation area to the northwest of the visitor centre, using Robinia hardwood logs and sawn timber, ropes and hand-woven nets manufactured using steel reinforced polypropylene, with the appearance of traditional hemp cordage, the applicants say.

A supporting statement accompanying the application says the design proposal, produced by Earth Wrights Ltd, is about "increasing play value and creating a place inclusive for everyone".

"Once the vision was clarified, the play area was designed with the key objectives of enhancing the existing informal recreation space and increasing opportunities for different types of play.

"The proposed play area will comprise a variety of timber play equipment, with interconnecting ropes and hand-woven nets, to provide a range of play activities for children of all ages. The play equipment will be constructed of natural materials, using durable, Robinia logs and sawn timber.

"The proposed play area will be small scale, extending to 100 square metres in surface area and just 2m in height, ensuring that the timber play equipment will be visually unobtrusive with no adverse impacts on the local landscape or visual amenity of the area.

"The additional visitors and users of the play equipment would generate minimal and localised noise impacts, confined to the Welsh Wildlife Centre complex itself, with no impacts upon residential properties or other sensitive receptors, given the extensive separation distances to neighbouring development."

The application will be considered by county planners at a later date.;

We all understand the significance of being kind and polite to those around us. However, not everyone seems to grasp this concept, leading to moments of shock when someone snaps at you in a supermarket for not moving quickly enough down the aisle or shows impatience with a service worker who's simply trying to perform their duties.

As individuals, we generally don't enjoy seeing the unkind succeed, and that's where a bit of petty revenge can be quite satisfying. There's nothing like securing the best table in a restaurant by being courteous to the staff while watching a discourteous patron create a scene over it.

A woman on TikTok has become an internet sensation after sharing her small act of retribution against some supermarket shoppers who were needlessly rude to an employee attempting to assist them - and she's received online accolades for her approach.

In her video, the woman recounted how she was in the pasta section of her local store when she overheard three women discussing plans for a charcuterie-style meal with various meats and cheeses. They then approached a store worker with a question, and their manner of doing so appalled the woman.;

After dealing with a group of Hilichurls, you'll come across a room with a yellow barrier at the top during the 'Beneath the Crystal Rock' quest. Deal with the Hilichurls at the bottom of this room first, then indwell the yellow-coloured Tepetlisaurus Spiritsconce found at the bottom (if you aren't already in your Tepetlisaurus Saurian form).

You're now ready to solve the short puzzle.

To find a way down during Beneath the Crystal Rock in Genshin Impact, you need to:

Checking the yellow spot destroys the ground beneath you, so make sure you're done with this room before doing so! If you have forgotten to pick something up though, don't worry too much, as you can always come back later when the route loops back round to the room with the large crystal in it.

You have to indwell a Koholasaurus during the next part of the quest, but these puzzles are thankfully a lot more straightforward to understand than this one.

Make sure you pick up the Red Metal Key at the end of the Koholasaurus section if you want to open the side gate in the room with the large crystal, as it leads to three chests: two common chests and a precious chest. The precious chest is particularly useful, as it might contain an Obsidian Fragment for an Obsidian Ring.;

Kotug International has won a contract to provide marine services supporting an Eni floating LNG project in West Africa.

Eni is developing the Tango FLNG project off the coast of the Republic of Congo using an Excalibur floating storage unit (FSU), with a second FLNG currently under construction.

To support this gas export development, Kotug will deploy three Rotortugs to support a range of operations, including mooring and unmooring vessels, handling mooring equipment, providing standby services, transporting pilots and oilfield goods, passenger transport services and pollution response.

Each of these tugs will have three thrusters, a bollard pull of 80 tonnes, a high level of redundancy and fast handling, said Kotug.

The Rotterdam, the Netherlands-headquartered owner said it will maximise local content by collaborating closely with local suppliers, use local goods and services, and employ and train Congolese nationals, "contributing to the sustainable development of the local economy.";
        
            Title: Historic pub is open again following major revamp | TheBusinessDesk.com; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/news/2128419-historic-pub-is-open-again-following-major-revamp; type: news; Description: An historic Holmfirth pub reopens today - 30 August - after a five-week closure and a £275,000 refurbishment.

The revamp of The Shoulder of Mutton on Dunford Road has transformed the previously rundown local.

The project was carried out by Heineken-owned Star Pubs and The Shoulder of Mutton's new operators Yorkshire pub company TL Inns, which has 15 pubs across the region.

Sean Womack from Doncaster is taking the helm as the new licensee.

The Shoulder of Mutton is believed to be amongst the oldest pubs in Holmfirth, with records of landlords dating back to 1803.

Exterior works on the three-storey building included cleaning the Yorkshire stone, repainting and adding new signage, planters and barrel tables at the front.

A space at the rear has been transformed into an enclosed 64-seater alfresco area complete with festoon lighting, planting and a covered pergola with heaters for year-round use.

Inside The Shoulder of Mutton incorporates features such as the traditional style bar, a restored fireplace and quirky artwork.

There are four regularly changing brews on tap with accompanying tasting notes, and customers are welcome to "try before they buy".

The pub also stocks an extensive selection of other drinks ranging from classic cocktails to all-day barista-quality coffee. Complementing the drinks are tapas-style British pub classics for snacking and sharing, such as mini fish and chips, burgers and loaded waffle fries.

Womack said: "The Shoulder of Mutton has stood proud in Holmfirth for more than 200 years, and it's been sad to see it lose its way in recent times.

"It looks fantastic now, thanks to the investment. It's exciting to be opening the doors and showing everyone the changes. People who've seen it are bowled over."

Claire Richardson, Star Pubs' business development manager for Holmfirth, added: "We're happy with the revamp and we hope local residents are too.

"The Shoulder of Mutton is very much a traditional pub with fantastic beer and a warm welcome but has a twist that brings something different to Holmfirth.;
        
            Title: 'We are all in shock': Staff furious as ambulance firm ceases trading abruptly; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.kentonline.co.uk/dartford/news/we-are-all-in-shock-staff-furious-as-ambulance-firm-cease-312124/; type: news; Description: A private ambulance company that provided non-emergency transport for NHS patients to reach hospital appointments has suddenly ceased trading.

SVL Healthcare Services sent out text messages late on Tuesday night telling staff to cease operations immediately and promising more information would follow.

But since then, staff at the Dartford-based company whose operational base is at Stone Castle in Greenhithe have heard no more.

It is believed the firm employed around 390 staff including drivers, office and support staff.

Andria Meyer had been employed as an ambulance driver for the the past 18 months.

She said: "We are all in shock and very worried whether we will receive our pay due this Friday.

"Many of us live month by month and some people will be unable to pay their mortgages or rents now.

"I personally was also due 56 hours overtime pay which I suppose I will never see now."

Ms Meyer said staff had been given no information as to whether the company was in administration or liquidation.

She said: "We've heard nothing. I'm worried for the patient we used to pick up. I was doing about 10 transfers a day.

"The renal patients have to go to hospital three times a week. How will they get there now?"

Drivers from the Stone Castle base served hospitals as disparate as the Princess Royal in Bromley, Queen Mary Hospital in Sidcup, and the London hospitals of Kings, Guys and St Thomas'.

The firm had also just a month ago picked up a contract to provide ambulance services to hospitals in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, which have also ceased.

According to reports by the BBC, the NHS integrated care board there was told by SVL it had ceased trading on Tuesday (August 27) and had entered into administration.

Andrew Creasey, 53, had been a driver for a year with the firm in Kent. He too was angry for the way staff had been treated - and for the effect on the people they served.

He said: "Patients will have been put at risk."

The company had failed to register its last set of accounts with Companies House.

Gary Mitchell, who worked in a high dependency unit for the firm transferring patients who need medical care during the journey, was told to down tools mid-shift.

He had been taking a patient from an examination at Kings College Hospital back to a ward at the Princess Royal Hospital in Orpington, when he received a text telling him to stop working.

Gary said: "We should have known something was going wrong.

"For the past six days our fuel cards stopping working, and then a few days later the tracker system on the ambulances stopped too."

KentOnline has since heard from another former worker who says they'd had no confirmation as to whether they will get paid for the last two months having not had pay slips today (August 30).

A spokesman for the King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: "SVL Healthcare Services have a contract to provide non-emergency patient transport services for King's, as well as Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.

"On Tuesday evening, SVL informed both trusts that they would be unable to provide these services from Wednesday onwards.

"Our staff have worked tirelessly to ensure continuity of service for our patients, and we are working at pace to identify a long-term alternative provider of these services.

"We would like to apologise to the small number of patients whose appointments have had to be re-scheduled as a result of this week's events.

"We are continuing to provide non-emergency patient transport services for our patients, and our teams are doing everything they possibly can to ensure the disruption to patients is kept to a minimum."

A spokesperson for Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust said: "Thanks to the phenomenal work of our patient transport team, who worked through Tuesday night making alternative arrangements, over 95% of our patient journeys on Wednesday went ahead as planned.

"We apologise to the small number of patients whose appointments have been rescheduled as a result of changes to their healthcare transport services.

"We are continuing to provide non-emergency patient transport services for our patients, and our teams are working hard to ensure the disruption to patients is kept to a minimum.";

Caro Wilkinson, who taught Mr Swinney German when he was a pupil at Forrester High in Edinburgh, was among a group of campaigners from the Edinburgh Climate Coalition to stage a demonstration as the SNP conference got under way.

She recalled her former student as being "intelligent and caring", adding: "His kindness was clear when he organised a class whip-round when I was pregnant to buy me a teddy bear for my new baby."

However, she also insisted the First Minister was "clever enough to know how urgent the threat of climate change is", adding that she hoped he "cares enough for the planet to take the action that's needed".

Ms Wilkinson said: "If he does, he'll speak out against the huge Rosebank oil field, reject the proposed Peterhead gas-fired power station and do what he can to put the Scottish Government back on course to fight climate change."

The conference comes after the Scottish Government ditched its target to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030 - although ministers insist they are still committed to the overall goal of reaching net zero by 2045.

Commenting after the protest, Edinburgh Climate Coalition spokesman Luke Henderson said: "People around the world are already suffering from the impacts of changed climate in fires, floods and landslides, but the Scottish Government is going backwards and slowing down the action that will improve lives and cut climate pollution.

"Renewable energy is already far cheaper than new fossil fuels whilst solutions like making public transport more affordable and accessible will help more people get to where they need to be.";

            Title: The free transfer strikers available to Derby as Rams chase crucial signings; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfers-free-agents-9519861; type: news; Description: Derby County are trying to secure their last deals of the transfer window for the final time until January with a striker top of their priority list.

Premier League loans are the order of the day, but Paul Warne admitted yesterday that free transfers could also be an option. Free agents released inside the window are permitted to sign for clubs outside it.

Last year Derby signed Dwight Gayle as a back-up measure when James Collins got injured and it is something they have done before. Here Derbyshire Live takes a look at the strikers that may be of interest and are available for nothing.

Aaron Connolly

The former Brighton striker is a free agent after being released by Hull City where he scored eight goals in 31 appearances this season.

Can be a bit hotheaded, but there is no doubting there is an excellent striker in there but will realise that he is approaching a crossroads in his career. Former Derby interim boss Liam Rosenior was a big fan which is why he took him to Hull having seen him come through the ranks at Brighton where he helped them win promotion to the Premier League.

After Connolly scored a brace against QPR in a 3-0 win last year, Rosenior said: "I've known him since he was a kid and I love him.

"If he misses the first chance he'll take the second one. His timing and movement is so good and he's showed exactly why I wanted to bring him to the club. He'll be the first to admit he's made mistakes, but you've got remember that he's just 23.

"He's emotional at times and when he first came to the club, he was on his best behaviour. But I didn't want that, I wanted him to be himself. I believe in him. He's a natural."

He needs to knuckle down after some off-field controversies, but Warne does like a player with a point to prove. Connolly is certainly one of those.

Scott Hogan

Currently a free agent after leaving Birmingham City and would certainly provide a physical presence up front which is what Derby lack. Has a record in the Championship of 67 goals in 259 appearances. The problem with free agents is they are on the list for a reason.

His form at Birmingham City tailed off, but then Birmingham's story as a whole should be taken into consideration given they are now playing in League One.

Clearly the off-field problems that were happening at Blues had their impact until Knighthead Capital came into the rescue.

"I'll be honest I was a bit annoyed the way it was going after lockdown, what was going on around the manager, it didn't bode well. I will say I got really annoyed I am probably not the only one, fans and obviously the board, players and stuff like that. It just fell apart," he said previously.

So at 32, has Hogan got one final move in him that could see him recapture the early form of his Birmingham career. The jury is out on that one.

Kemar Roofe

Still only 31, Roofe finds himself at a crossroads again after leaving Rangers and a need to find somewhere that can reignite his career. Scored just twice in the SPL last season which is probably a factor as to why he is looking for a new club.

There were rumours he was training with Oxford, the club where he enjoyed plenty of success but that was quickly rejected by boss Des Buckingham.

"Kemar Roofe has not been training with the club, and hasn't been in the club at all. He's had a wonderful career, certainly from here and where he's gone on to play. We've said we want to bring in a centre forward. We need to make sure they fit what we want them to do. Kemar has got a lot of strong qualities, as have a lot of other centre forwards that we're looking at.

"It's about taking our time and making sure we get the right decision because it is a very important one for us." Has Championship experience with Leeds United and fetched some big sums in his career.

Lucas Joao

Registered 19 goals in the Championship four years ago at Reading and was hot property at one time - and proved the scourge of Derby County in a 2-0 defeat when he was at Sheffield Wednesday.

"I thought Joao was excellent," said Rowett who was Derby managed at the time. "I thought at times he was unplayable, he shows he's very unpredictable and difficult to get the ball off. But to allow him to turn and to allow him to have that much space is very unlike us and then it's a fantasic finish from him which Scott Carson couldn't do much about.

"At 2-0 down then for the rest of the game I don't think Scott's had a save to make and then if you look at their goalkeeper and defenders they have had to work incredibly hard to keep the ball out."

Joao left Reading in 2023 after the club were relegated to League One and there have been rumours that he would consider a return to England after spells in China and then Qatar. At 6ft 4in, he would certainly add presence to the frontline.

            Title: Lawyer explains chances of boss accepting four-day working week following new Government plans; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.ladbible.com/news/uk-news/four-day-working-week-labour-government-keir-starmer-562966-20240830; type: news; Description: Keir Starmer's Labour government is set to introduce the four-day working week idea right across the country

A legal expert has issued advice on your chances of securing a four day working week under new plans laid out by Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government.

Starmer has instructed the Department for Business and Trade to explore introducing new employee rights, which mean you can ask your boss to do your work over four days rather than the standard five.

And in doing so, the Government has stressed that it would be an application which can very much be turned down by your employer.

"We have no plans to impose a four-day working week on employers or employees. Any changes to employment legislation will be consulted on, working in partnership with business," a Whitehall spokesperson said.

"Our Make Work Pay plan is designed around increasing productivity and creating the right conditions for businesses to support sustained economic growth."

Those applying for a four day week would have to do 'compressed hours' whereby you do your contracted hours over four days, rather than five.

It comes just days after leaked plans showed the prime minister is set to launch a huge crackdown on smoking which will include beer gardens, with critics claiming that it will hurt hospitality businesses.

And in response to the plans, one employment law firm, BDB Pitmans, has issued advice and eight reasons why your employer can refuse a request to go to a four day working week.

Nicholas Le Riche, a partner in the Employment Law team at BDB Pitmans, explains that while compressed hours might be a dream for the employee, it could be quite the opposite for your boss.

But he has not gone as far as saying employers will be terrified of the proposals, given the move to remote working during the Covid pandemic, with millions then moving in to a hybrid working pattern once the lockdowns ended.

"I wouldn't expect employers to be 'petrified' by these proposals given that working compressed hours is not unusual and businesses are now well accustomed to dealing with flexible working requests," Le Riche said.

"However, what employers will want is clarity on their ability to refuse these types of requests and how tough it will be to show that compressed working isn't 'feasible'."

He added: "If employers are still able to rely on the current eight reasons to show that a request isn't reasonably feasible then this could provide some reassurance to businesses.

"What this change is likely to do is force employers to show why flexible working can't be accepted rather than require the employee to show why it should."

According to BDB Pitmans, the following eight reasons will be the most common reasons cited if your request to go to a four day working week is denied:;
        
            Title: Friday High Five - the news this week | TheBusinessDesk.com; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/northwest/news/2138742-friday-high-five-the-news-this-week-9; type: news; Description: Clearly nobody told the Gallagher Brothers that you never launch anything in August.

The news that Oasis are to reform not only led most of the national news this week, but has remained our most popular story on TheBusinessDesk.com too.

It gave us an opportunity to tell something of the most remarkable business success story in the region that you've probably never heard of, SJM.

Named after concert promoter Simon J Moran, who started the business in the 90s putting on student gigs, he now runs one of the most powerful businesses in the global entertainment industry out of a small office in Manchester city centre.

It was good of Manchester cultural chronicler Andy Spinoza to note our story on Tuesday that "followed the money" behind the Oasis reunion and the role that SJM were playing in the live music event of 2025.

The first hint that this was real was a visual display at the Wythenshawe Park concert of Stockport icons Blossoms on Sunday night, also an SJM production.

Since then we've also been inundated with press releases from rent-a-quote experts about what this might mean for the economy - supersonic, evening glory, you name it, they didn't hold back on letting the cliches roll (with it).

SJM has stayed true to its roots in Manchester, as the business has gone global, and Moran has bought Warrington Wolves Rugby League club. In that same spirit, the modest success of Blossoms has also reinvested into businesses and property in a resurgent Stockport.

But unless Noel Gallagher's private office is an investor in a northern private equity fund, one run by a fellow Manchester City fan maybe, to the best of my knowledge all the wealth and money generated by the Oasis has never returned to the North West.;
        
            Title: Manchester United agree transfer deadline day loan exit for young defender; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-agree-transfer-deadline-29837737; type: news; Description: Manchester United defender Sonny Aljofree is set to join Accrington Stanley on a season-long loan.

Aljofree was identified as a youngster who would benefit from a loan away from United. Accrington finished in the bottom half of League Two last term but the fourth tier has proven to be a helpful education for a handful of United youngsters in the last few seasons.

Goalkeeper Radek Vitek signed for Accrington on a six-month loan in the January transfer window and his temporary spell away was considered a success by United. It's hoped Aljofree's time at the club will help his development as he looks to strive toward making a first-team debut at Old Trafford, which is his ultimate target.

Aljofree signed for Altrincham on a flexi-loan in the January window and spent a few months around the non-league side's squad. The innovative loans allow youngsters to gain senior experience whilst remaining involved in the day-to-day environment at Carrington.

Centre-back Aljofree didn't make an appearance for Altrincham, but the flexi-loan system has been effective elsewhere, helping Sam Mather to develop at Rochdale, for example.

Elsewhere, as reported by the Manchester Evening News earlier in the week, centre-back Rhys Bennett has signed for Fleetwood Town on a season-long loan. Bennett travelled to the United States for this summer's pre-season tour and made substitute appearances against Arsenal in Los Angeles and Liverpool in South Carolina.

The youngster captained the Under-18 team that lifted the FA Youth Cup in the 2021/2022 season, scoring the opening goal of the final against Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. Young goalkeeper Elyh Harrison has also completed a loan move to Chester FC.;
        
            Title: Thousands of people 'only receiving fraction of full state pension'; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/24551971.dwp-pension-warning-thousands-only-receiving-fraction/; type: news; Description: Pensioners have been warned that only half of them are getting the full weekly amount of the new state pension.

New analysis has shown that around 150,000 pensioners were on less than £100 a week.

Royal London said that 1,737,342 of 3,407,567 people receiving the new pension received the full weekly amount last year.

It made the calculations using Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) data from spring 2023.

The full state pension for 2024/25 is £221.20 a week, up from £203.85 last year.

In general, to get the pension people need to have 35 years of national insurance contributions (NICs). Those with fewer "qualifying" years receive a proportionately smaller state pension.

Royal London found that 149,317 pensioners who had reached state pension age from April 2016 were receiving a state pension of less than £100 a week - and 17,546 pensioners were receiving less than £20 a week.

It also said that 5,677 people were receiving less than £10 a week.

The new state pension system was introduced in 2016 to provide a sustainable, clear foundation pension for people to build their private savings on.

Many people will have other sources of income alongside the state pension, such as workplace or private pensions.

Pensioners on low incomes may be entitled to claim pension credit, which can top up their incomes and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) recently launched an awareness drive to boost take-up.

While around 1.4 million pensioners are already receiving pension credit, there are up to an estimated 880,000 households eligible for the support who are yet to claim.

Around 10 million pensioners are set to lose out on winter fuel payments as the new Government restricts the benefit to only those receiving pension credit.

The move was announced by the Government as part of a package of measures designed to tackle a £22 billion "black hole".

Sarah Pennells, consumer finance specialist at Royal London, said: "We often talk about the full state pension amount, but these figures show how many pensioners are getting only a fraction of that.

"One of the main reasons why people miss out on the full state pension is because they have gaps in their national insurance record, but they may not realise this until it's too late to do anything about it.

"You may have national insurance gaps because, for example, you were working but had low earnings, were unemployed but didn't claim benefits, were a high earner with young children who didn't register for child benefit, or because you were working abroad.

"The good news is that, even if you have gaps in your national insurance record going back over a decade or more, it may still be possible to top up your national insurance contributions and increase the amount of state pension you're entitled to.

"Under the new state pension system, you don't get any state pension at all if you have fewer than 10 years' national insurance, so it's important to check your national insurance contribution record."

A DWP spokesperson said: "Ensuring a better deal for the pensioners of today and tomorrow is a priority for this Government.

"There are a variety of reasons why some pensioners have a lower state pension - including contracting-out and paying less national insurance contributions - which is why we encourage those on the lowest incomes to claim for pension credit, worth on average £3,900 per year.

"Through our commitment to protect the triple lock over 12 million pensioners will benefit, with many expected to see their state pension increase by around a thousand pounds over the next five years.";

The company is famous worldwide for a range of products ranging from ketchup and beans to soup and pasta sauces.

But the latest edition to its range has been met with mixed opinions.

With how to perfect making carbonara a hot topic online, Heinz said it has been working hard to create a "fail-proof, quick and easy carbonara that comes with absolutely zero drama".

Heinz's new Spaghetti Carbonara will be available in supermarkets across the country from September. (Image: Heinz)

The new Heinz Spaghetti Carbonara, it said, achieves just that providing a tasty carbonara recipe that's fail-proof and that takes all the fuss out of cooking, allowing pasta lovers to nail it every single time.

Meals Director at Kraft Heinz, Alessandra de Dreuille said: "We understand that people are looking for convenient meals that are effortless to prepare, and our new Spaghetti Carbonara delivers just that.

"It's the perfect solution for a quick and satisfying meal at home.

"Whether enjoyed as a comforting meal after a long day or shared with friends whilst catching up on the latest TV series, Heinz Spaghetti Carbonara is the perfect fuss-free dinner solution."

News of the new tinned Heinz product has left some fans excited.

One person, commenting on a post about the tinned pasta on the Facebook group Extreme Bargains UK, said: "I may have to try this hahah love a pasta in a tin."

Another simply added: "Yummm."

While a third person commented: "You know how i feel about food in tins (sick emoji) BUT id actually try this."

But others weren't so complimentary of the new Heinz carbonara.

One user on X (formerly Twitter) commented: "This abomination is beyond the pale. Shame on you."

The new Heinz Spaghetti Carbonara is available to buy online, via its website, now.

It will be available in supermarkets across the UK from September for £2 (RRP).;

The iconic ocean liner will depart Cunard's spiritual home the following day, Saturday, September 7.

Cunard began passenger services between Europe and North America in 1840.

Since then, Cunard ships have crossed the Atlantic every year, beginning with the paddle steamer Britannia, which departed Liverpool on July 4, 1840, bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Boston.

Queen Mary 2's historic voyage to Liverpool began in New York on August 23, where she commenced her 400th crossing of the Atlantic.

She arrived in her home port of Southampton on August 30, when she began a British Isles cruise.

She will depart Liverpool on September 7, heading for Cobh, in Ireland.

The visit marks Queen Mary 2's eighth call at Liverpool and is expected to draw large crowds along both sides of the Mersey.

This call will also be the first by a Cunard ship in Liverpool since the spectacular Naming Ceremony of the line's newest ship, Queen Anne, which took place in front of 50,000 spectators at the Pier Head in June this year.

Cunard President, Katie McAlister, said: "Cunard's 184-year connection with Liverpool is something truly special, woven into the history of both our company and the city.

"We're incredibly proud of this bond and can't wait for Queen Mary 2 to return, marking her 400th Atlantic crossing.

"It feels right to celebrate this milestone in the port where our transatlantic journey began in 1840, and where our newest ship, Queen Anne, was named by the city of Liverpool in June."

She added: "I'm excited to be back in the city and by the waterfront."

A special event on board Queen Mary 2 will honour the Liverpool partners who were instrumental in delivering Queen Anne's Naming Ceremony.

Queen Mary 2 is due alongside at Liverpool Cruise Terminal at 1430hrs on Friday, September 6.

Spectators are expected to line vantage points at Formby (1230) and New Brighton and Crosby, near the mouth of the river, (1300).;

The complete set, including stores in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, will employ 1,000 people and Homebase workers at risk of redundancy will be guaranteed an interview.

Damian McGloughlin, the managing director of Homebase, wrote to suppliers on Thursday (August 29) to say it was trading "behind where we planned to be" and would begin an "active sale process" to seek new investment next week, The Guardian reports.

The locations of the Homebase stores Sainsbury's will be buying are:

The converted shops will add a total of around 235,000 square feet to Sainsbury's' supermarket trading space.

It added that the first of these shops is expected to open as a supermarket next summer, with plans to complete all the conversions by the end of 2025.

Simon Roberts, chief executive of the supermarket group, said: "Sainsbury's food business continues to go from strength to strength as we push ahead with our Next Level Sainsbury's plan.

"We have the best combination of value and quality in the market and that's winning us customers from all our key competitors and driving consistent growth in volume market share.

"We want to build on this momentum which is why we are growing our supermarket footprint.

"Our ambition is to be customers' first choice for food and these new stores will showcase some of the best that Sainsbury's supermarkets have to offer to even more communities around the country."

The expansion comes five years after Sainsbury's closed 15 large supermarkets and dozens of Argos stores after discounters Aldi and Lidl stepped up expansion in the UK, putting pressure on traditional chains.

The Guardian reports that Homebase's current owners Hilco tried to sell the brand four years ago and reportedly put it back on the market this spring.

The DIY chain was created by Sainsbury's in 1979 and sold off by the supermarket in 2006.

After the sale of the 10 stores, it will shrink to just over 130 outlets, almost half the 250 it had when Hilco bought it for £1 from the Australian retail group Wesfarmers in 2018.;

Hill brings extensive experience in multi-channel retail logistics and supply chain roles gained over three decades.

At ASC, he will spearhead the strategic commercial direction of the business to support the company's continued growth in the UK and Europe.

His career has spanned senior roles at FedEx, Home Delivery Network (now Yodel) and Collect+, establishing its click and collect concept in the UK.

He was part of the founding team at Sorted Group, which grew to be a global software-as-a-service company working with brands such as Dyson, ASOS and M&S.

Most recently, he was chief commercial officer at boutique 3PL business, 3PL.

Hill said: "I was aware of ASC and admired the business' progress and its clear ambition for the future.

"While the business remains highly entrepreneurial, we are also part of Reconomy, which adds a clear strategic benefit and value to our customers and team, as the wider business has significant scale with sustainability in its DNA.

"With so much M&A in the logistics sector, there's a significant opportunity for mid-market operators with size and agility to support more retailers and brands to gain a competitive advantage.

"ASC knows and really plays to its strengths in inbound logistics, pre-retail services and returns. I'm looking forward to working with the team and our customers to achieve our growth ambitions in the UK and Germany."

ASC invested £60m into its expansion with a new European operating facility in Nettetal, Germany in July 2023.

The site provides a range of services covering pre-retail, returns processing, fulfilment, wholesale distribution, and transportation to retailers and consumer brands across Europe and the UK.

Ben Balfour, managing director, said: "Andrew is an excellent addition to our team. He understands the challenges and opportunities facing retailers and brands.

"Throughout his career, he has been in roles and businesses at the forefront of retail market shifts, driving innovation and subsequent growth.

"It's fantastic to have him on board to support our ongoing expansion in the UK and Europe."

Reconomy is an international circular economy specialist which enables businesses to better manage their resources, helping reduce waste, optimise their supply chains, and contribute in a meaningful way toward the circular economy.

ASC's previous commercial director, Caroline Ellis, has transitioned to a new role within Reconomy as a key account director working with fashion brands.

Sheffield's Knight Frank has promoted commercial property surveyor Harry Orwin-Allen to associate and has recruited Eddie Slater to join the team as part of its work placement scheme.

Orwin-Alllen joined the Sheffield office as a graduate surveyor in 2020 and has worked with a range of clients and developers across South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire office and industrial market.

He has now established himself as an industrial specialist and has worked with clients including Mileway, Logicor, Devonshire Group, CRT and Roe Developments.

Rebecca Schofield, partner and office head, said: "Harry's promotion is thoroughly deserved he has contributed to the continuing success of the Sheffield office of Knight Frank and has successfully built a reputation in the industrial sector handling a wide portfolio of clients."

Real estate student Eddie Slater, 20, joins the Knight Frank team as part of his degree at Leeds Beckett University.

He will work with the team on industrial and office agency matters across South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire for the next year.

Slater said: "To secure a placement at Knight Frank, with its global reputation and respect, means I can apply the classroom knowledge to a real life environment.

"Even though I am from Sheffield, I am already getting to know the whole region on a much more detailed level and see how buildings and people interact."

Schofield added: "All our placement students gain a valuable insight into life as a commercial property agent, honing both their technical and commercial skills.

"As a company we are keen to support the undergraduate work placement scheme, to invest in talent and build our future property professionals."

Former placement student Kitty Hendrick joined the Sheffield office full time after completing a year in industry at Knight Frank during her degree at Sheffield Hallam University and is now a surveyor at the firm.

James Warner who completed his placement year last year has continued within the firm's Valuation and Landlord and Tenant team.

Halifax-based CorkSol, a UK distributor of CorkSol's SprayCork material, specialising in sustainable wall coatings, has strengthened its team with the addition of Danny Tunstall, who will be project manager.

He joins from Barratt Homes, where he was a construction site manager and has a wealth of experience in the construction industry.

Tunstall said: "I was excited to hear about a vacancy at CorkSol as SprayCork is an interesting product that I'd heard about in previous roles.

"It feels like I'll be a part of something that will have a positive effect on the construction industry.

"During my initial meeting with the company, the brand values resonated with me, and I'm looking forward to contributing to further growth as we push the business to new heights."

CorkSol is celebrating a series of business wins contributing to rapid growth for the company in the past 12 months.

It is is currently collaborating with My Growth Engine and Pure Agency. These agencies are working towards increasing the company's brand awareness, generating leads and growing the approved applicator network across the UK.

Chris Heaton, CorkSol marketing manager, said: "Our growth truly reflects the hard work and dedication we've put into the business since 2017.

"With a strong team who are invested in improving the quality of buildings in a sustainable way, we're incredibly proud that CorkSol is getting recognition and continuing to expand.

"We have exciting plans for the future, and working with new agencies will bolster this and result in further year-on-year growth.";
        
            Title: Eddie Howe: Newcastle's league dream still alive but will take longer to achieve; date: 2024-08-30; URL: https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/sport/national/24551908.eddie-howe-newcastles-league-dream-still-alive-will-take-longer-achieve/; type: news; Description: When Amanda Staveley completed her takeover at St James' Park in October 2021, she spoke of the club winning the Premier league within a five to 10-year period while Yasir Al-Rumayyan, club chairman and governor of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, signalled his intention to establish it as "number one".

Efforts to strengthen this summer, which have been hampered by profitability and sustainability rules, have so far come to nothing, with Crystal Palace's England defender Marc Guehi remaining stubbornly beyond their grasp as the transfer window entered its final 24 hours.

However, asked if the club's fans had been sold a false dream, head coach Howe said: "I don't think the dream dies, necessarily, but I think it takes a lot longer.

"We've got to build our revenue streams, that is the biggest thing. We've got to bring more money into the football club however we do that, through player sales, through sponsorship, through loads of various things. That's the big thing that we need to focus on now for the next, probably, 10 years.

"Whether I'm lucky enough to see any of that, who knows? But the dream is not over, it's just going to take a lot, lot longer."

Newcastle's owners have invested more than £400million in the squad since their arrival on Tyneside, but have made just one major signing - £55million Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali, who could make his first Premier League appearance since October against Tottenham on Sunday after completing a 10-month ban for betting offences - in the last three windows.

A summer during which Staveley and husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi have left the club has proved challenging to say the least, with midfielder Elliot Anderson and frontman Yankuba Minteh having departed in a bid to comply with PSR limits amid speculation over the futures of big names Bruno Guimaraes, Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon.

The club's pursuit of Guehi has developed into something of a saga, but with just hours of the window remaining, Howe, who has studiously avoided commenting on individual players throughout, remained pragmatic.

He said: "We've got to try to hit it right and if we don't, then probably doing nothing, as frustrating as that is, is probably the best option."

That may cut little ice with fans who had hoped the rebuilding programme would continue apace this summer after last season's seventh-place finish, 12 months after the Magpies had secured a top-four spot and Champions League football.

Asked if the club had "failed" this summer, Howe, who denied suggestions they had placed all their eggs in one basket with Guehi, replied: "I'm not going to sit here and say it's been a brilliant transfer window for us. I think everyone will look at me and think, 'I'm not sure he's telling the truth there'. I do try as far as I can to tell the truth.

"But it's not been through the want of trying from anybody's perspective and I think for me to sit here and say that would be totally wrong as well. Everyone has tried really, really hard to improve the squad to make sure we've got a chance of success.";

Caro Wilkinson, who taught Mr Swinney German when he was a pupil at Forrester High in Edinburgh, was among a group of campaigners from the Edinburgh Climate Coalition to stage a demonstration as the SNP conference got under way.

She recalled her former student as being "intelligent and caring", adding: "His kindness was clear when he organised a class whip-round when I was pregnant to buy me a teddy bear for my new baby."

However, she also insisted the First Minister was "clever enough to know how urgent the threat of climate change is", adding that she hoped he "cares enough for the planet to take the action that's needed".

Ms Wilkinson said: "If he does, he'll speak out against the huge Rosebank oil field, reject the proposed Peterhead gas-fired power station and do what he can to put the Scottish Government back on course to fight climate change."

The conference comes after the Scottish Government ditched its target to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030 - although ministers insist they are still committed to the overall goal of reaching net zero by 2045.

Commenting after the protest, Edinburgh Climate Coalition spokesman Luke Henderson said: "People around the world are already suffering from the impacts of changed climate in fires, floods and landslides, but the Scottish Government is going backwards and slowing down the action that will improve lives and cut climate pollution.

"Renewable energy is already far cheaper than new fossil fuels whilst solutions like making public transport more affordable and accessible will help more people get to where they need to be.";
